She develops a world unlike any others while keeping it firmly in the real world.  This is a very well written and entertaining novel.  I was quite impressed and intrigued by the way that this solid storyline was developed, bringing the readers right into the world of the story.  I was engaged throughout and definitely enjoyed my time spent reading it.I loved the character development in this novel.  Da Silva creates a cast of high school students who actually act like high school students.  I really appreciated the fact that none of them were thrown into situations far beyond their years, nor did they deal with events as if they had decades of life experience under their belts.  It was very refreshing and added to the realism and impact of the novel.  The friendships between the characters in this novel were also truly touching.Overall, this novel was fantastic.  I can&#8217;t wait to read more and to find out what happens next in the series.

It certainly came to me highly recommended. My husband and I read this book along with the companion workbook with 4 other couples, and it was and arduous journey. For our group of Christian couples in happy marriages, there was just too much that did not apply to us. Sure, we each picked up a handy tip here and there, but it wasn't enough considering the length and repetitiveness of this book.I agree with the basis of Eggerichs' main point in this book: If she gets the love she needs, she will give him the respect he needs, which will cause him to give her the love she needs. You get it - it's the cycle of love and respect. I gave it to you in one sentence instead of 24 chapters. If this book was about a third the length, I probably would have rated it at least 1-star higher.Every time our group met after the first time, we felt like we were struggling to get something new out of what we had read. The workbook is even worse. The questions are extremely verbose restatements of what is already written in the chapters, and there are a lot of them. Each couple would need to invest a couple of hours into each session, only to feel like we were trudging through the same material each time.We were also disappointed by the lack of scriptural references. Though the book is loosely based on Ephesians 5, the author rarely includes scripture in the chapters and more often uses letters from happy Love & Respect retreat participants as teaching tools. Our group was hoping for more Biblical discussion than what we got.If your marriage needs work and you and your spouse have trouble supporting each other and understanding each other's point of view, this book may help you.

Despite all the mixed reactions people have had to the New 52, I've been hearing a lot of great things from people I trust about this new take on Wonder Woman. But I was still on the fence so I waited until my library got a copy of the trade. Now after reading I feel like an ass for waiting for so long, because it is awesome.Wonder Woman has always been a blending of mythology and the DC universe, but Azzarello takes it to the next level. While some mythology and DC purists might not like the changes, I loved them. On so many levels.First, the feel of this story has more of a mythological atmosphere. It reminds me a lot of Neil Gaiman's Sandman series. We're dropped into the story, with a narrative that sounds right out of folk tale and action befitting a flagship title for DC. Yeah, this is a Wonder Woman title, while many people view her as a diplomat and peace keeper, they forget that she is also an Amazonian princess, equal in strength and power to Superman. In this story Diana doesn't hesitate to kicks ass and takes name.The story is compelling, the art is stunning, but above all that, this is a Wonder Woman I can relate to, as well as admire. She is bold, conflicted, and rightfully so. The very foundation of her existence is shaken. Everything about how she viewed herself, and her mother changes in this story, and still Diana stays true to herself and her mission.This is a dark story, lots of bloodshed, death and raw humanity. Which is right up my alley. The supporting cast is great, and diverse in very surprising ways (I LOVE Chaing's take on all the goods, especially Apollo). Gods like Hermes, Apollo and Eris are deeply involved in the story, along with the very human character Zola, who plays a big part in the story. Zola is awesome, she delivers a lot of fantastic lines that made me laugh out loud, but is also very sympathetic. She didn't ask to be thrown into the middle of a godly power struggle, but she does a great job of coping with all it.I also love the look of Diana in this book. Yes, she still has the hour-glass figure of the classic Wonder Woman, but she is taller, and broader. She looks like an Amazon of legend. She also fights like a warrior, gets in the action. Chaing does a fantastic job with action shots, and her design. Giving us enough of the old to keep her familiar, but with a whole new take on everything from her costume, complexion and stature. Paired with Azzarello's fantastic storytelling, we get a great example of a what a reboot can do. This team does it right.I can't recommend this book enough. Even if you've never read comic books, if you like Wonder Woman, mythology, or just stories featuring kick ass women at the helm, you should give this one a try.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A New Take on Wonder Woman, and I love it!", "unixReviewTime": 1398816000, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2014"}

This book is a nice antidote to those two extremes because it is at times both funny and insightful in a rueful and self-deprecating way.  By that I mean Ms. Gurwitch knows her way around a one-liner and around an extended goof of a story, (see \"AuDum at the Apple Genius Bar\"), but she also has a handle on wry commentary on the state of the recently 50. The emphasis is on wry commentary - there's no over the top hysteria, no relentless kvetching, no excess. We all get older, and some of the stuff associated with that is funny, or at least can be given a good-humored spin. That's what's going on here, and it is all done with honesty, a keen eye for the absurd, and a grown up appreciation of people and their foibles and preoccupations.

However, she redeemed herself, by bringing MIL for a visit, and then eventually keeping her.If I were describing the novel on a graph, I&#8217;d say it starts ok, then goes down down down, then gradually goes up to a nice level.

Even though I am not quite finished with this book, and still have a few pages remaining, I wanted to go ahead and write the review because I have learned and enjoyed so much during its reading. In fact, as soon as I am done writing this review, I am going to go finish the book.I grew up in a home, church, and social circle that viewed all forms of alcohol as ... well... evil. When it was mentioned that someone was drinking or that someone drank occasionally or socially, it was absolutely appalling. I am not sure how much of this was because of actuality or because of my perceptions of the situations where drinking was encountered, but it was a definite no-no to drink in any way, shape, or form.When I got older, I began encountering people that caused my views to conflict with the reality around me... in other words, I was meeting people who were clearly steadfast Christians, but they would drink occasionally or socially. My worldview didn't allow for this. In fact, many of the drinkers that I met were by far more dedicated to the cause of the gospel than the teetotalers that I had known. So I did what any good Christian would do... I shunned them and ignored these conflicting worldviews. WAIT! NO! I went to the Bible to determine the truth! What I found was quite different than what I had &#34;known&#34; growing up. My views needed adjusting.When I eventually encountered Drinking With Calvin and Luther!: A History of Alcohol in the Church by Jim West, which was a Christmas gift from my wife, my views had shifted appropriately and were fairly solid now on what the Bible actually teaches concerning alcohol, but were still hazy on the practicality of these new views. This book served to solidify those views, and give me direction on how to practically apply those views. It is a very Biblical book, but what was absolutely surprising to me was the actual history of alcohol in the church, which this book does an absolutely amazing job of bringing to light.I have a great respect for church history. I believe that it is important what Christians have believed historically. This is why I am a big supporter of reading and learning from historical documents, creeds, and books. Like Paul writing to Timothy, I am often saying, &#34;Don't forget to bring my scrolls!&#34; (2 Timothy 4:13) ... well for me ... &#34;books!&#34;  I mean, really, who am I, or who are we to believe that the last 2000 years Christians have gotten  it wrong? In fact, tracing the beliefs that have stuck can be extraordinarily enlightening. The amount of historical information and quotes that Jim West shares from remembered and respected Christian leaders through the ages was extraordinary. It never felt cumbersome reading this book, but I did find myself often wanting to quote different portions of this book. Especially those encounters with quotes from Martin Luther, like:&#34;Do not suppose that abuses are eliminated by destroying the object which is abused. Men can go wrong with wine and women. Shall we then prohibit and abolish women?&#34;~Martin LutherJim West also confronted the different teachings of the prohibitionist's views by going directly to the scripture. He displayed an amazing knowledge of the topic from the historical, the Biblical, and even the opposing view points. If you are actually interested in learning what the Bible teaches concerning alcohol, then I recommend this book. If you want to learn the Church's historical stance concerning alcohol, then I highly recommend this book.I would like to point out in advance, as a Pastor myself, that there were many members of the clergy, through the ages, that were paid ... not just monetarily, but with kegs of beer for the purpose of entertaining.

I loved this book from beginning to end! One thing I find particularly appealing about Eloisa James is her uncanny ability to describe a person, not just their looks but their feelings as well and in this book she did not disappoint. Her description of India's reaction to a particularly condescending marriage proposal is a case in point, \"Aggravation marched up her spine like a troop of perfectly dressed soldiers.\"Both India and Thorn are strong characters, exceptionally good at what they do and accustomed to being in command, so when they get together sparks fly. A particularly witty exchange of letters early in the book in which neither backs down but both clearly enjoy the correspondence hints at the relationship to come. Despite their strength of character and despite their stubbornness both India and Thorn are vulnerable, largely due to difficult childhoods yet it is those hard starts to life that have shaped them into what they are. It is those vulnerabilities that made me warm to them.I found this book hard to put down. I found myself sneaking a few chapters when I woke in the middle of the night and struggling to stay awake so I could reach the end, yet also wanting to carry on living with the characters, and I guess that's the mark of a good book.

This part I found interesting in part because I know many civil servants and people who live in housing projects.The narrator gets fired from the civil service then works for a famous writer named Osano.  This part of the book is boring.  We don't know much about Osano except that he wants to win the Nobel prize in literature and lives like a pig.  While we don't know what makes Osano a leading figure in US literature but we do know about his numerous personal failings.  This part of the book is bad.The best part of the book is the ending where the narrator goes to Hollywood and to me the book ended with a punch.  Some of the books stories of Hollywood life were excellent.There are some parts of the book that describe the workings of Las Vegas which I also thought was outstanding.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Parts slow and other parts outstanding", "unixReviewTime": 1403827200, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2014"}

So it was natural that I read her latest book. and was pleasantly surprised in the direction in which it took, a departure from pure crime to a more traditional novel. I am told that it is the first in a planed trilogy.It a novel with broad mature understanding that examines bonds people form: those between siblings, child to parents and vice-versa, to friends, comrades in arm, and even with four legged creatures. In this case the animals are primary horses. I know little about horses but my own dogs and cats provides me with a feel  how much a person can love and cherish an animal. However the size of horses adds an element of danger to the relationship as a horse can accidental or intentionally kill a person.The story centers around two families of the horse set, one that breeds and trains horses and the other who has a family business manufacturing transportation equipment for horses. There are a number of lesser characters that cluster around the families. The various threads of  relatioship quickly weave an interesting narrative filled with action and drama that should hold any readers attention.

Every chapter seems to end with some variation of the line, '... and then we'd find the Panther.  And one of us would die.'  And there are 83 chapters.  I thought we were being set up for some alternate ending in which this did not happen, but DeMille is not John LeCarre (thankfully).  But the actual ending isn't all that satisfying.The author takes a shot at fleshing out the bad guy character early on, which was interesting, but then he just drops it and becomes repetitive.  The closer-to-home bad guy is a walking cliche.  John Corey's capacity to just be a plain jackass has grown beyond amusing here, and Kate Mayfield is given almost nothing to do.Almost all the action is packed into the last few chapters, and then, just when things got rolling, a sudden ending that wasn't worth the previous 500+ pages, basically reading about meetings.  The ending seems to leave open the possibility of a sequel, which could pit John Corey against one of his teammates from this book, whom he would secretly want to succeed.  Probably woouldn't be great.If you like this kind of stuff, and have already read the first four John Corey books, read any of the Sean Drummond books by Brian Haig instead.

Luna is witty, tough, proudly dysfunctional in a gleeful sort of way, yet honestly broken, too. And though she's got a lot of Buffy Somers in her - she's not the &#34;Chosen One&#34; with super powers or super strength or resiliency. She knows the demonic because it's haunted her since childhood. She can see demons, she can fight them,  but the only thing she's got up on regular human beings is her knowledge and association with demons, and that's it.The story's pacing is smooth, with easily-consumed, concise chapters, and the story moves right along. Yardley is very confident in telling this story, and making this world seem real.  Also, we get the sense that the supernatural world we're exposed to here is merely a fraction of what's to come, so if you like supernatural mythos/mash-ups like The Dresden Files or Supernatural, this might be a good fit for you, also.Finally, I do want to address the issue of some tense slippage, which I saw someone mention in another review (that ironically misused grammar in its title). There is a little tense slippage, between first person present and first person past. But experienced readers will realize these are merely blips that got overlooked in the editing process, and they in no way detract from the story at all.

Vera heads to work one evening and when she leaves there is snow blanketing the ground and her son is gone.

The pain she went through is something no mother should ever have to go through.

She worked hard to make life as good as she could for her son, and it was so easy to feel the love she had for him.Claire is going through her own heartache.

That is how it is essentially portrayed in the media and the scientific establishment.Author Jonathan Wells, however, is anything but politically correct.  He portrays the debate as a conflict between two views of what is real.  On the one side are the Darwinists, protectors of a materialist creation myth which begins with the words \"in the beginning were the particles in mindless motion.\"  And on the other side are proponents of intelligent design, most of whom would affirm John chapter one, \"in the beginning was the Word.\"Not all I.D. proponents are Christians, but all are open to the possibility that nature may show the hallmarks not only of natural causes but also of intelligent causes.  This is decidedly a politically incorrect point of view, and with examples Wells illustrates the professional cost one may incur for holding it.By citing philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, he shows why the current Darwinian power structure is digging in its heels and refusing to consider evidence that does not comport with its materialist paradigm.  But if Kuhn is right, Wells has reason to be confident that even now we are seeing the beginning of a paradigm shift as the last and strongest bastion of nineteenth-century materialism - Darwinism, crumbles before the growing onslaught of the evidence.

Sometimes he is one of the antagonists and sometimes he is a secretly sentimental.  In Suzan Lauder's debut novel, Alias Thomas Bennet, she places Mr. Bennet in a role he does not often have the good fortune to occupy &#8211; the role of hero!In this novel Mr. Bennet takes more interest and care in his family.  He doesn't make sport of or ignore his wife, and she in turn is a bit more sensible and economical.  He isn't careless with his finances and management of Longbourn, which results in a very comfortable living situation and adequate dowries for his daughters.  When Mr. Darcy comes to town, he finds the Bennets (especially Mr. Bennet and Elizabeth) to be very intelligent and pleasant company.  How do the improved manners and abundance of propriety in the Bennet household effect the illustrious Mr. Darcy of Derbyshire...Is Elizabeth still inferior?  Is marrying her still a degradation?What an originative take on Pride and Prejudice! I enjoyed seeing how the different dynamics of the Bennet family impacted the storyline, and the happy and congenial atmosphere around Longbourn was heartwarming to witness.  Much better than their usual disorder and disfunction!  I enjoyed seeing Mr. Bennet be active in his daughters' lives and take steps to protect them from Wickham.  While at times, I may have thought the Bennet family a little too near &#8220;pictures of perfection,&#8221; I overall enjoyed seeing them portrayed in a more favorable light for a change!What I loved most about this story was that it had a duel plot &#8211; besides the present-day story of Mr. Bingley letting Netherfield Park, readers learn about the traumatic experiences Mr. and Mrs. Bennet faced twenty years ago and how those experiences brought them together through periodic flashbacks.  For me, learning the secrets of their past and witnessing their falling in love was my favorite part of the story.  More so than the Darcy and Elizabeth  storyline!  (I know, how shocking, right?!?)  In fact, I would have loved to see more of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet!  Especially Mrs. Bennet &#8211; if Mr. Bennet is this story's hero, I think she should be the heroine. :)Unique and enthralling, Alias Thomas Bennet is a wonderful choice for readers who want to see a different side of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet!

The day she leaves her home to find work, she has an unexpected guest. Marco Black, from Nemesis Unlimited, has taken the job of trying to get her fortune back. Nemesis heard about Bronwyn's trouble from her former maid. They normally didn't help the nobility, but they were convinced that Bronwyn was worthy.They soon learn that Bronwyn's late husband's business manager stole the money to cover his gambling debts and travel to Paris to find him. After locating the man, they learn that he owes money to one of France's most ruthless crime syndicates, Les Grillons. Unfortunately, the business manager can't pay back the money he owes and is soon killed. Since Bronwyn and Marco witnessed the murder, they are now on the run from Les Grillons.Marco searches out a former associate of his for help. While running from Les Grillons, Marco and Bronwyn can't fight their attraction to each other and soon become lovers after agreeing that this would be a short affair. But what happens when their feeling start to run much deeper?I LOVED this story. You see bits of Marco in the other books in the series and knowing that he was a spy for England had intrigued me. His story did not disappoint me.Browyn was not your typical society wife. When she lost all her money, she didn't lose it. She had set a plan in motion when Marco swept in to help her find the missing money. Had she been the typical society miss, Marco would have never fallen for her. His background working with Nemesis has given him a dislike of the upper class. It said a lot to Marco that Bronwyn's maid was the one asking for help. She had to be someone special to inspire such loyalty from an employee.As with all the other stories in the series, the significant other seems to fall right into the life of Nemesis. The organization plays such a big part in their lives that the relationships wouldn't work otherwise. Because of this, these stories are not your typical historical romance with the relationships taking place at several society balls. If you are looking for that type of story, this book (and series) is not for you. But if you are looking for a historical romance with some adventure and mystery then this is the series for you.

It&#8217;s TNG&#8217;s chance to experience the &#8220;mirror universe&#8221; we got to see on-screen in both TOS and DS9, and, as I expected it to be, it was well written, with a few moments that really delighted me.One was the introduction of the dolphin, Hwiii, a hyperstring researcher who &#8216;swims&#8217; through the ship in a sort of water skin. Another was when Data, meeting Hwiii, tilts his head for a moment and then &#8216;speaks dolphin,&#8217; because, of course he does.I liked that Geordi and Deanna were the initial away team to the mirror Enterprise, and that they both got to use the knowledge they gleaned both from study and experience. Some of my favorite episodes were when Troi actually got to be a psychologist, and in this novel, she uses that training as much as she uses her innate empathetic abilities.Similarly, Geordi&#8217;s incredible depth of knowledge is highlighted in this book, as he works, sometimes with colleagues, and sometimes alone, to figure out a way to save, not just the ship, but the universe itself.I&#8217;m not sure when this was originally written but it felt like early TNG-fic. Data is very &#8216;sciency&#8217; but doesn&#8217;t have as much depth as he does in later novels &#8211; even in later pre-emotion-chip ones. It&#8217;s obviously before the contemporary push for continuity within the novels, but it&#8217;s still an entertaining read.Trek fiction is my crack.

There is so much raw emotion, and battle scars in this book I feel like I need therapy!  Sergeant First Class Reza Iaconelli, where to start&#8230; My heart broke for him. He was pure male power wrapped up in a lot of personal demons.  I seriously had to catch my breath a couple of times with him.  He is full of contradictions.  Physically he is all male. Big and physically strong.  Emotionally he is living one day to the next trying to function as best he can.  He tries to be the best Sergeant he can for his soldiers.  He is sympathetic to their insecurities yet battles with how to adequately prepare them for the realities of war and military life.  Reza is a recovering alcoholic, he struggles everyday with his addiction.  He is also surrounded by soldiers that have the same struggles.  Aside from struggling with alcoholism he is also dealing with PTSD.  Reza came with his own scars before joining the military and we learn about his home life and how it shaped him.Captain Emily Lindbergh is the opposite of Reza, although she struggles with her own personal issues, she comes from a life of privilege.  Her father was in the military but she never personally experienced the life of a soldier.  She is trying to bring help to soldiers such as Reza and his men, but not everyone thinks this is a good idea or is very welcoming to her.  Emily was a fantastic character.  She tried to show the soldiers her commitment to their mental health and was often the target of military personnel&#8217;s wrath.  Emily is alarmed at the high number of suicides and tries to provide the soldiers with some psychological support.As a couple Emily and Reza where exact opposites yet perfectly matched.  Where he is physically strong and emotionally weak Emily is physically weak but emotional very strong.  They had excellent chemistry and I loved that they formed a strong friendship.  I loved that they each met the other where they were at.  Emily never tried to &#8220;fix&#8221; Reza she accepted and gave him the support he needed although at times did not want.These characters were so real, Scott really peels back all their emotions and gives us two very vulnerable people.  When I read &#8220;Back to You&#8221; I felt the same way.  The characters were both so imperfect and so real.  Ms. Scott really captures the damage that soldiers experience during combat, after, and before.Honestly, this is a tough read.  I put the story down a couple of times, not because it was not well written or interesting, because it was all of those; but emotionally very challenging.  The characters were worth it.  It&#8217;s not a light read but it does provide a very &#8220;unromantic&#8221; look at the hardships of war and military life.  Overall, I think I can say that I recommend everything and anything written by Jessica Scott.  She really knows how to strip down her characters and show us who they are.  After the emotional odyssey it&#8217;s beautiful to see Reza and Emily find their way together!

It's got delicious sexual tension as well. She is very close to being a writer I would automatically buy. There are just a couple things about her writing style that bother me a bit, but it may not be an issue for anyone else. One is that she over-complicates the internal  conflicts to the point that it's a bit too much and a little convoluted. I don't think I've ever had this problem with a romance novel, since too much depth is not usually a problem, but I think she could pull back a bit on that and give more plot and external conflicts. There was never much standing in the way of their romance except their own issues, which were real and compelling but got to seem like they were over-done to sustain them through the book. And she piled them on, not so much heaping too many things so much as examining them in-depth and in excruciating detail, in many different ways over and over. This leads to my second issue, which is way too much interior dialogue, characters dissecting everything that happens when we've already get it. Much of this could have been cut out so there was a better balance of action and dialogue and the more interior writing.

I would rate the book 2.5 stars with a summary that the author has the beginnings of what could be an interesting series, but would caution that Creedor itself is an average stand alone novel that lacks a cohesive storyline.  In the first 20% of the novel we are introduced to characters and a plot that I assumed would be the basis for the rest of the book, but this is not the case.  After being introduced to Jarlord (obvious antagonist) and the wizard Vandalen (obvious protagonist), we move on to new characters and plots that end up taking shape and making some sense, but by that time the reader is at the end of the book.....which ends rather abruptly just as I felt like I was beginning to make sense of the story.I will admit that I am not normally an avid reader of fantasy or science fiction, so I was likely not as patient as I might otherwise be with what I considered a disjointed storyline that I had difficulty following at times.

This, since I have read a lot of books with similar story lines. However I was very wrong. Even though the big picture was alike other books it was so unlike anything I have read. I absolutely loved it and was constantly surprised. Never a dull moment and I was instantly caught in the story and did not want to go to work lol!Some parts of the story was making me so sad and where heartbreaking. It almost made me cry! Other parts had me laugh out loud.Charachters:Ellie Holbrook is the heroine in the book and I loved her. She has a very rough past littered with abuse, drugs and so on. When she finds herself pregnant she is forced to grow up and she excels at it. She is so mature for her age and is awesome with her daughter Sophie. She is confident and knows what she want. She does not joke around and when she knows what she wants she goes after it.Nicholas Grayson is the ultimate douchebag! I absolutely hated him in the beginning. His attitude sucked and I could not stand him. He did what he wanted just because he could. No caring at all if his actions harmed others. Bleh! Selfish bastard! That was until he met Ellie. She started out as a bet and eventually became so much more. Nicholas started to realize that the front he had put up was not going to work with Ellie and she made him want to be better.Romance:There was a lot of romance and it was hot and sizzling! A bigger rollercoster I would have to look for. Ellie and Nicholas love story has so many ups and downs that you almost get dizzy. But it totally works and thats what makes their love so awesome. The can be so perfect together and other times they are a total disaster waiting to happen. As the book so adequately is called their love really is a beautiful disaster :)Action:Not much action as in real fighting but there was a lot of other types of action in the story. It felt like it was Ellie and Nicky against everyone else all the time. A lot of other characters had their own agenda as to why they should not be together and had no limits of how far they would go to get it.Cover:Simple and lovely!

Epic!Awesomeness is not a good enough word to describe this brilliantly written story &#8211; No I think Epic would sum it up nicely.  This captivating story is filled with a humorous seductive romance that kept me glued to the pages and wanting to live in their world forever.  The author&#8217;s descriptive details of the Highlander&#8217;s country side and their clan&#8217;s leaves the reader with a breathtaking vision that will forever be melded into your heart.  The character&#8217;s chemistry and humorous banter will forever have you longing for more of their story.Edmund MacGregor is a man of his word and beliefs.  God-like example of David & Goliath, the metaphor is clearly a Highlander conquering and ending the Giants of Aristocratic Nobility&#8217;s political gains.  His presence bleeds sexuality with his stance and handsome features, but his voice and actions will melt your heart first with a wanting desire.Dedicated to his cause for love of country and keeping the English from signing a treaty that will unite Scotland under their rule, he can only come up with one solution and puts the plan in motion to keep the treaty from happening and that is to capture the niece of the Duke of Queensberry.  However, what he doesn&#8217;t anticipate is falling head over heels in love with his charming captive Miss Amelia Bell.  No his adventure turns into not only a win for Scotland but a fight for an unconditional sacrifice for love than to ever live without her.Amelia has got to be my favorite character of all time.  I absolutely loved her.  I never laughed so hard &#8211; I literally had tears coming out of my eyes with her accident prone actions.  She reminded me of &#8220;KANE - the demon of Disaster&#8221; from the series Lords of the Underworld where every time she touched something or went somewhere disaster followed her in a humorous way.Amelia truly captured my heart with her tender innocent demeanor.  She is one of those females that is not only beautiful on the outside but on the inside as well.  Her loyalty and dedication to her family is unconditional but her love for true passion puts a few adventurous curves in her road to happiness especially when she meets her dreamy godlike &#8220;David of Goliath&#8221; Edmund.Tormented between having a life with a man of her dreams and with honoring her father&#8217;s wishes of an arranged marriage to Seafield - the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, a man she doesn&#8217;t love.  Amelia&#8217;s heart breaks knowing the sacrifice she must make in order to not ruin her father&#8217;s status among the English aristocrats.The story is full of adventure and lots of Highlander action making it a fast read.  The sweet and tender erotic romance had the perfect amount of teasing and playful love making scenes (3 Flames).  The happy ever after had me smiling and hugging the book with giddiness.I have to say that this is my first book by Paula Quinn and I am awed in amazement of how addictive her writing is.  The plot was perfect, the characters were brilliantly created, and the world building is one I could live in forever.

Berg.  This is Leah and Declan's story.  Both of whom were introduced in When You're Ready.  If you recall Leah is Clare's best friend and a nurse at the hospital where Logan, Clare's new husband works.  Declan is a famous movie star and one of Logan's college buddies.  Leah and Declan have a one night stand in book 1 and book 2 pretty much starts a few months later.I'm not going to rehash the entire book or reword the synopsis.  I am going to tell you right off the bat that overall I thought this was a decent story.  Was it as good as book 1?  In my opinion, no, and I hope to tell you why I did and didn't like it.I thought the characters in Never Been Ready were well developed.  We get lots of insight on both Declan and Leah's upbringing as well as who they are as adults.  We learn what makes them tick, what makes the love and what makes them laugh.  Declan and Leah together on the pages are hot and steamy as well as light and fun.  There are even some poignant moments.  Those poignant moments are what I think J.L. Berg is really good at writing.I loved all the moments with Clare and Logan.  I missed them and I was super happy to have them back.  I also appreciated the introduction of Clare's brother, Garrett.  There were many obvious moments in the book where Garrett was being set up for book 3 in the series, Ready For You.This is the tricky part for me.  How to explain what I didn't like.  The only word that keeps coming to mind is lackluster.The premise of the story was good.  Leah's childhood plays an important role.  Logan's childhood as well is integral.  The way their two lives ultimately intersect is also really important and was well thought out.  There was even a shocking moment that gave me goosebumps.  Goosebumps are always good!!  I just felt like the journey to get to the good stuff felt forced and quick.  For instance there is a certain scene between an actress and Leah at an awards show.  I felt like that particular moment had absolutely no bearing on the story as a whole.  The story wasn't really about Declan as an actor and whether or not Leah could handle it.  There was also a scene near the end involving Leah's father.  It may have been an attempt to tie up loose ends.  Maybe even an attempt to open Leah and Declan's eyes.  Again, I thought it was unnecessary.  The story would have been good without it.  I didn't think Leah needed that closure.  I didn't think Declan needed that push.I felt this story had a much deeper meaning than a hollywood actor who sweeps a woman from an abusive home, off on a whirlwind relationship.  It was about two people broken and bruised by their parents, being able to come together as a couple and finding their way towards a future with each other.  It was about embracing the future and accepting what's in front of you.  Accepting who you are, what you're capable of and what you can offer someone in return.  This was a story about love, forgiveness, and hope.For as many times as I rubbed my eyes and scratched my head in frustration, I was however, also rewarded with those special moments.  This is where I love J.L. Berg's writing, there is so much potential here.&#34;But that kiss?  That kiss left me awe-struck.  It was earth-shattering in its simplicity, mind-numbing in its intimacy, and completely raw in its emotional depths.&#34; - LeahSigh....see?  That's beautiful right there.  Give me more of that and less fluff.  It's okay to have lots of angst, inter-mingled with funny and lighthearted moments, while still being able to give us beautiful lines.  I don't mind the insights into each others worlds.  On the contrary those are important for character development.  It's the other stuff, like the moment with the actress, or the box that Declan takes from the attic of Leah's childhood home, that doesn't reappear again until nearly the end of the book.&#34;Shit.  I'm going to cry again.  Why do I cry so much around you?&#34;&#34;I don't know, but I'll hold you every time you do.&#34;I remember when I read that part I had to stop and smile at my husband because that's something he would say to me.  Those are the moments I like to look for my stories.  The stuff I can relate to or dream about or swoon over.  There is a really good story here in Never Been Ready, it just didn't come together for me as a complete package.Should you read this book?  Absolutely.  It might not be my favorite but it's still a decent read.

I would recommend Mead's book if for no other reason than it has inspired me to pick up &#34;Middlemarch&#34; and give it another try. Mead gives a believable interpretation of Dorothea's actions and motivation, as well as an analysis of each of the major characters. Yes, there are many of what we today call &#34;spoilers&#34; included in this examination of Mead's favorite book, so if you have not read &#34;Middlemarch,&#34; and wish to, be warned.In addition to discussing the characters and the story of &#34;Middlemarch,&#34; Mead looks at George Eliot's life as it mirrors the various aspects of the book -- youth and the desire and need to find one's place in the world; love and courtship; what constitutes a good marriage or a bad one; how to deal with an intimate relationship with another person; growing older, and eventually death. Mead's book has been called a memoir by some critics, because she does mention some pertinent parts of her own life, and some actual physical journeys made back to England to look at many of Eliot's haunts. However, Mead's life is only a very small part of this book -- most of it has to do with the life of the author of Mead's favorite book, the lovely and haunting writing style, the sly humor, and the pointed observations on the nature of mankind that came to fullest fruition in &#34;Middlemarch.&#34;I do understand an obsession with a particular book -- mine being &#34;The Forsyte Saga&#34; by John Galsworthy. I have read Galsworthy's masterpiece at least one in every decade since the 1960s (and sometimes more than once). As &#34;Middlemarch&#34; calls to Mead, &#34;The Forsyte Saga&#34; calls to me, and I find something new in it every time. Just as Eliot knew the heart of her characters, even the more unpleasant or unsympathetic ones, I found myself identifying with the same character (&#34;Soames Forsyte&#34;) as I became older. While Galsworthy was not happy that so many readers identified with Soames, Eliot seemed to understand and forgive the characters, such as Casaubon, who were less than perfect and who presented barriers to loving and being loved over and over.I think this book will appeal to many different sorts of readers -- those who share the author's love of Eliot and &#34;Middlemarch,&#34; those who appreciate a well-written book that examines an author's life and work, and those who want to pick up Eliot's masterpiece but have been afraid to do so for any one of a number of reasons. Good show, Ms Mead, good show.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Homage to a Favorite Book", "unixReviewTime": 1392681600, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2014"}

Each chapter reads like that day's ramblings, not related to anything that's come before. Maybe he wrote this as therapy. Maybe he was bored by taking time off to rediscover his muse. (Btw, he found it. He recently played Carnegie Hall to some of his best reviews). Either way, this is Neil's mind, seemingly fully exposed. It's quirky, to say the least. And repetitious. This could have been cut in half. Still, you won't really mind because Neil really does have a lot to say, and much to recall of his storied career, which peaked by the early 70s. Yet, he's still creating great music, and his voice is still one of the wonders of rock. He is completely right in his crusade to upgrade the recorded music listening experience. Music did sound better before digital, and we have gone seriously backwards. He wants us to be able to feel music again. I hope the industry listens.

Delicious. . . absolutely delectable!As a child, Portia had a dream to run her grandmother&#8217;s restaurant (The Glass Kitchen) in Texas; however, after settling for a different life (married to a senator which betrayed her with her best friend, and did not allow her to use her cooking talents); a life derailed, she finds herself divorced, and moving to Manhattan to join her two sisters, Olivia and Cordelia.Portia is sure she was responsible for her grandmother&#8217;s untimely death and gives up her passion of cooking, due to this misconception. She inherited the ancestral gift (a knowing about events thru food), and her Gram instructed her how to use her abilities, leaving some helpful cookbooks and tips (how to heal certain illnesses with specific foods, among other things).Portia escapes Texas, and moves to the Upper West Side in a rundown brownstone townhome (garden lower level apartment), she inherits from her Great Aunt Evie, filled with fond childhood memories. However, she has no job skills and no divorce settlement (her first job was a hoot)! Her two sisters have sold their share of the townhome, to the handsome investment banker man who lives upstairs on the upper two floors (Gabriel Kane). The other two sisters are not without problems either.Gabriel lost his wife a year earlier, and is raising two daughters, Miranda (16) and Ariel (12, almost 13), and things are not going well in this household--total dysfunction and lack of communication. He wants to buy Portia&#8217;s garden apartment; however, she does not want to sell as this is the only thing she owns.The last thing Portia wants is to get involved with a man and his daughters. She has problems of her own &#8211; like how to survive in NYC! However, the minute she meets this man &#8211; her food thoughts come back strong, and no matter how much she tries to escape, the more she is pulled into this world of food, cooking, and lust.However, fate steps in and forces Portia to do what she loves best in life &#8211; COOKING, as a means to support herself &#8211; working for handsome and complex Gabriel, while planning her test kitchen with the two sisters, sending aromas to the streets of NYC, while seeking investors for their desired new restaurant (The Glass Kitchen)--if they can find the capital. Some good comfort Texas food, gourmet style in for fast pace NYC&#8212;putting her cooking skills to work to bring in the customers (and investors).Of course, to really make it yummy, nightly midnight visits (down the fire escape)to the garden level, from the complicated, hard nose, but sexy Gabriel, with some irresistible delights and surprises.All is not rosy and uncomplicated in this Upper West Side neighborhood. There are many twists, and obstacles along the way in this messy family of Kanes &#8211;from Gabriel&#8217;s mother, his brother Anthony, Gabriel&#8217;s former wife, and mother of the girls, with a secret past and events leading to her death, which shake Ariel&#8217;s world, as well as Portia.With quirky neighbors (Stanley and Marcus), supportive sisters, hot sex, some strong women, yummy gourmet recipes, love of food and recipes for life, with a young girl&#8217;s determination to put her family back together, to one&#8217;s woman&#8217;s courage and journey to fulfillment and passion &#8211; a meal you will want to savor!Linda Francis Lee created an irresistible banter and chemistry between Gabriel and Portia, which will keep you smiling and rooting for this sizzling, yet odd couple. And oh, Aerial will melt your heart, with her intelligence and winning personality, as she finds her way.There are many parallels here, and would be ideal for book clubs or discussions. Portia and Ariel, are very similar&#8212;both are youngest of sisters, guilt ridden, undervalued by others for their intelligence, keen sense of humor, talent, style, and passion &#8211;both courageous and determined to make things better, as they discover their true self.From the inviting front cover to the delectable and mouth-watering recipes &#8211; a captivating novel of love, forgiveness, family, courage, and the determination to follow your heart and dreams.I was traveling while reading this book, and had to get up extra early, in order to finish THE GLASS KITCHEN, this morning before getting back on the road. Could not wait to see what would happen to these unforgettable and lovable characters. A five star winner! Looking forward to reading more from this insightful and talented author.If you are a fan of contemporary fiction, chick lit, romance, humor, southern women&#8217;s fiction, love of gourmet food, and family dynamics, you will be assured to enjoy this magical novel, where life is not always perfect &#8211; as the fun is in the &#8220;messiness&#8221;, with some courses and recipes to sweeten the deal.Fans of authors Sarah Pekkanen, Emily Giffin, Mary Kay Andrews, Sarah Rayner, Jane Green, Sarah Addison Allen, Susan Rebecca White, Mary Ellen Taylor, Joanne Demaio, Beth Hoffman, Nancy Thayer, Wendy Wax, Mary Simes, or Dorothea Benton Frank will find THE GLASS KITCHEN, fresh, irresistible, funny, and quite satisfying.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Loved everything about THE GLASS KITCHEN!", "unixReviewTime": 1403740800, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2014"}

It is essentially split up into two parts, so I&#8217;ll take it one at a time.Part 1:  The continuing battle with Uncle Aaron:While Miles and Aaron team up together at the beginning of the volume, they inevitably battle, as Aaron&#8217;s blackmailing of Miles is finally resolved.  Frankly, I was shocked by how it was resolved.I haven&#8217;t mentioned this in previous reviews, so I wanted to take this opportunity to say that I really like the fact that Miles&#8217; power set is different than Peter&#8217;s old power set.  Sure, there are some similarities, but then there are also some drastic differences.  The camouflage and venom blast are especially awesome.From here on out, there will be spoilers until I get to Part 2.  The death of Aaron was tragic and necessary.  As the Prowler, Aaron is a villain, and an enemy to Spider-Man.  The fact that he knows Miles&#8217; secret identity means that he couldn&#8217;t have stayed in the story unless he turned good.  Aaron wasn&#8217;t on that trajectory, so he had to die, for the sake of the story and the character.  But how he died, accidentally being killed by his nephew, is so tragic for Miles, who now has to live with this as a 13 year old.  In an interest parallel, the death of Uncle Ben influenced the way Peter Parker would live as Spider-Man, and I&#8217;m certain that the death of Uncle Aaron will impact the hero that Miles becomes.  Aaron&#8217;s dying words, &#8220;How about that?  You are just like me,&#8221; will surely haunt Miles for years.  He will now have to look his father in the eyes knowing that he is responsible for the death of his father&#8217;s brother.Part  2:  Working for Captain America:Although I&#8217;m not reading any other Ultimate Marvel books, it is clear that there is a storyline going on in which some sort of war has started.  Captain America is leading the good guys, and Miles joins by their side.  This section, called &#8220;Divided We Fall,&#8221; opens with the words, &#8220;Washington is decimated.  The government is a mess.  The Southwest is in chaos.  States are seceding from the union.  America is falling apart.&#8221;  This sets the stage for Miles going to war, but not before an opening scene where Miles&#8217; father tells him (Spoilers) the bad news that Spider-Man killed his uncle!Spoilers from here on out.  As with previous volumes, Peter&#8217;s cast appears in Miles&#8217; story.  In this volume, we get a crucial interaction as Aunt May and Gwen Stacy decide that it is time for Miles to have something that Peter built.  Web-shooters and the web formula!  I have to be honest, with all the other awesome powers that Miles had, I failed to realize that he didn&#8217;t have the ability to go web-swinging.  This will be even better now!  Since Miles&#8217; best friend, Ganke, is really smart, and knows his secret identity, he is tasked with the mission of creating the web fluid using Peter&#8217;s formula.Ultimate Maria Hill makes an appearance in this volume, and quickly realizes a connection between Spider-Man and Miles&#8217; family.Back in the war, chaos ensues, and Spider-Man is a big hero.  I really like it when Miles can work with Spider Woman (Peter&#8217;s clone, but in female form), this volume had a lot of that.  Plus, there was further character development with Miles&#8217; parents.  Another great Spider-Man book.I read this volume right after reading volumes 1 and 2, and it was a good experience to read the whole story (so far) straight through.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Spider-Man teams with the Ultimates as the United States are torn apart", "unixReviewTime": 1389830400, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2014"}

Behind His Eyes - Truth is just another example of how Ms. Romig is at the top of her game and shows no signs of slowing down. Giving us Tony's POV is a huge treat, and helps us dive into the mind of this disturbingly, sexy, possessive man.In BHE - Truth, we are reminded, yet again, how powerful Anthony Rawlings really is. He is a man on a mission. He wants something he takes it. All throughout this story it's like you can hear him in your head, the anger, the desperation, everything this man feels, you are right there with him. Some might say we get so invested in this character, and we are so conflicted on how we feel about him, it can take a toll on us. I can certainly say, for a fact, that this series has taken a toll on me, in a bone-chilling, heart-racing, mind-****ing way, but I wouldn't have it any other way. These are the stories that stick with you long after you finish reading. It's what you start comparing all other books to. Nothing beats the raw emotion and intense feelings this series pulls out of you.Anthony Rawlings, Tony, Anton, Mr. Rawlings....no matter what you call this man, he will wreck you. He will make you hate him. He will make you feel sorry for him, and he will make you love him. This will go on and on, until you don't know what to think. No matter what you feel for him, the point is...you will FEEL.&#10077;She was his drug. Claire Nichols ran through his system like ecstasy, sending him on otherwise unobtainable highs.&#10078;In Behind His Eyes - Truth, Tony finally has to deal with circumstances beyond his control. That's not to say he won't try, but it's out of his reach. Conflicting feelings turn into clarity, and then to opportunity. Every little detail has it's reasoning. There are scenes that you appreciate getting a second look at. Maybe you will get some answers to some questions that have been on your mind. Maybe it will make you even more confused. No matter what, we get to see the two characters that we have fallen for happy again, even if for a moment in time. I'm pretty sure I said this in my last review of BHE - Consequences, but if you are an avid reader of this series, even though you know what's going to happen, it is still so **** intense!I could seriously go on and on about Tony. He is so incredibly fascinating. Some of you while reading this will have little smirks on your face at times. We get to witness Tony without control. He always has such an internal conflict when it comes to his Claire. The depth of his feelings for Claire is beautiful, yet a little scary, but it's nice to bare witness to such a gruff man come to terms with his love for another human being. For such a powerful man he has so many regrets. It's a little sick that I find some comfort in his suffering, but it reminds us that he is just a man.&#10077;He didn't want to be disappointed; however, more than that, he didn't want to disappoint.&#10078;So make sure you pour yourself a glass of wine, shot of tequila, or a whiskey sour, because this will take a lot out of you. Nobody can write intensity like Aleatha Romig. She is so high at the top of her game right now, I can't wait to get the final chapter in this saga.

I wish that there were more adult dystopian books but again this one is a Young Adult read. Not that I have anything against it but really someone needs to write an awesome Adult Dystopian novel!Divergent has been on my TBR (To be read) list for a long time and I was able to borrow this book from my friend finally and read it and I am so glad I finally was able to read this book! I am giving it 5 stars! Veronica Roth writes so well, there is no draggy parts at all, it has everything I could ask for. First of all, I think something that all dystopian books must have to be a good read is good action, during Tris&#8217;s Initation in Dauntless she does a lot of gutsy things, she jumps on to and off of trains, jumps off buildings, and climbs the ferris wheel at the old Navy Pier and that is just naming a few, I won&#8217;t tell you everything because I do not want to tell any spoilers. Roth also describes the landscape of Dystopian Chicago amazingly. I am obsessed with Chicago and have been there 3 times in the last 6 years to visit and the way she describes the places in Chicago and where Tris and her family and friends are at I can envision so clearly. There is also romance but not so much that it ruins the book and the meaning behind the book. Tris and Four are such a different couple then in most books I read and at the same time I can identify with them a little bit. I do not really have one bad thing to say about this book. If you like dystopian novels go out and try this one. I am looking forward to going with my co-blogger Colleen to see the movie so we can disect it and write a review of the book vs. the movie for everyone!Thanks always for reading!RochelleP.S.

I have been known to enjoy the serial books that are becoming a &#34;thing&#34; but, I think this book would have been better off sitting a little bit longer and coming out as a full story and not pieced out. I feel that the serials are meant for very emotional, and raw stories. Fix You didn't accomplish that with me. It felt disjointed and very rushed. I could not bring myself to like the heroine, Olivia, she seemed childish, and naive. Whereas, Bash has so much riding on his job, and seemed to be a stand up guy for his family until Olivia makes him lose his head. It just didn't click with me. The story, the characters, their circumstances and their chemistry. Something just seemed off.That being said, Fix You does have the potential to grow into a book I would like to read. It did end on a mild cliffhanger which will probably intrigue me enough to move on to the second book. But the second serial is going to have to possess major growth where Olivia is concerned, and more explanation where her family is concerned, and build more on Bash and Olivia's relationship. The way part one ended, it just felt like a physical connection with no deeper meaning between the two.Again, I don't mind serials but they have to be done fantastically. This one was just so-so, and the fact that it was a serial on top of that just made it more frustrating than anything. I want to be left needing and wanting more. Fix You just left me perplexed and wanting it to have gone the extra mile and reach its potential. I sincerely hope this was just a slow start and then next parts in the book will rise to the occasion.Happy Reading!*ARC provided by the author/publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "I really wanted to like it...", "unixReviewTime": 1397606400, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2014"}

I enjoyed the characters, their romance, and the storyline that Grace provided for us.Pacing: I felt this one was really well paced. Landon and Skye's relationship progressed quite well given their situation and Grace did a good job of keeping the story going without too many lulls or too much filler.Storyline: I really enjoyed this one. I do love the whole forbidden office romance going on and I liked that this storyline seemed to fall into place a bit more naturally than the first book in the series did. The story begins with Skye getting out of a messy potentially abusive relationship and starting a new job. She meets Landon Steele at a club one night and while she's not looking for anything more right now, she can't help the physical response he elicits from her. And then runs away. It made me chuckle because it sounds like something I would do! Unbeknownst to her, Landon is actually her new boss, which brings things to a whole new level of awkward and tense. Both know it would not be professional to have any kind of relationship, but staying away from one another is going to prove to be quite the task. Having to work closely together, it's only a matter of time before Landon and Skye give in. There was one obstacle thrown in I could have done without, as I felt it was added in to create more drama, which was unnecessary. There was already a more concrete storyline in place to add tension, and I felt that was good enough.Characters: I liked Skye and Landon. Skye is sweet and a bit of a seductress! She isn't actively looking to start anything else after getting out of her previous relationship, but things with Landon just happen and that kind of chemistry is just hard to ignore. She is close to her father and she doesn't want to do anything that will jeopardize his career, which is why she shoulders some things later in the novel on her own, instead of seeking help. She cares for Landon and doesn't want her mess disrupting his business, as he's worked hard to get where he is today.Landon is a great male lead. He's sexy, sweet, and dominant all in one. And man, do I love my dirty-talking boys! Landon could be a bit hard to read at times, but he is really a good guy who cares for Skye. He knows they should keep it professional, but working so closely with her does nothing to help his libido. Landon is very protective of Skye and he can't stand that her ex, Vic, hurt her. He refuses to watch another woman get crushed under the weight of a man, after seeing what his father did to his mother. He was the one to pick up the pieces and therefore, cannot let himself forgive his dad, despite his pleadings to see him and make things right.We also get to see Ellie, Mason, and Katie from Rumor Has It show up. Ellie and Katie are those girlfriends every girl needs in their life and I like that Grace included their friendship.Final Thoughts: Overall, I thought Picture Perfect was a great read. I liked seeing Skye and Landon's relationship develop slowly, as well as watch them fight the attraction they feel towards one another. Their scenes together were sexy and I didn't feel they were too over the top at all. There were a couple of things I could have done without, because I didn't feel they were necessary to fueling the plot. The storyline really did stand on its own, with their relationship, Skye's ex, and the matter of how important public appearance is to both of them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Enjoyed the characters, their romance, and the storyline Grace provided for us.", "unixReviewTime": 1401753600, "reviewTime": "06 3, 2014"}

Refusing to repent and name the partner in her sin, Rachel feels the wrath of the religious sect as she is shunned by those she loves most. She is eventually coerced into leaving by her brother-in-law, the bishop.But secrets run deep in this cloistered community, and the bishop is hiding some of his own, threatening his conscience and his very soul. When the life of Rachel&#8217;s baby is at stake, however, choices must be made that will bring the darkness to light, forever changing the lives of those who call Copper Creek home.I was first drawn to this book by the cover.  I like reading novels about the Amish, as long as they aren't preachy, and from my experience they usually aren't.  However, this book was about Old Order Mennonites, which is a religion that I know very little about other then that they are similar to the Amish in their Plain ways.The Outcast is one of those rare novels that shines in many ways. I was immediately drawn in because &#8220;The Scarlet Letter&#8221; is such a favorite, and I was not disappointed. Every character, every sub-story, every generation, every relationship in the book, is layered and intricate and nuanced. The story seemed to start a little slow for me but once I was a few chapters in, I couldn't stop reading. Everything about the book took hold and wouldn&#8217;t let go&#8212;until I finished.  Even though the Mennonite community is completely foreign to me, Petersheim made it both fascinating but wholly accessible and familiar. In every scene I felt I was right there with her and every character.  Each word written had true meaning to the story.  There was very little that felt like filler.The story was written in two voices.  One was Amos who was Rachel&#8217;s sister's recently deceased father-in-law and the other was Rachel's voice herself.  Amos's voice served as an omniscient voice for both of his son's, Tobias and Judah, as well as the moral compass for the story.  His words were used as a commentary on the happenings of the book.  At first I was worried that using a &#34;ghost's voice&#34; was going to be distracting to the story, it turned out that his voice was truly the perfect compliment to Rachel's and a unique way to give voice to the brother's without devoting more chapters to each brother.  Petersheim's use of this device shows that she is going to continue to be a fantastic writer.  For an author to write in such a unique and difficult manner shows her writing maturity which will only grow the more that she writes.  One other complaint is that the book ended a little too quickly and I wish there was more information on how the book ending came to be and what happened to the family after everything finally settled down.  I would love to see a sequel to this novel because I was so wrapped up in the characters that I feel like they are real people to me.I highly recommend this book to others.  Give the book a chance and keep reading if you feel like the beginning is slow or confusing.  The author does a good job of sorting things out for the reader as the story goes on.  This would be a 5 stars book for me but I want to hold back a little because of the confusing beginning and the abrupt ending.  This is a solid 4.5 stars!

His panoramic and in-depth view of the people and the events made his Histories a comprehensive study that is rare in history. And he was a master storyteller too. The story he was telling here was the complex political disputes and long standing social feuds between Greek cities and Asian peoples that culminated in the Greco-Persian Wars.Of course any translated book is only as good as the translator and the editor. This happens to be an excellent one because neither the translator nor the editor tried to show off their classical Greek training or their convoluted scholarly skills. They simply presented this book in smooth and clear English which made the reading easy without the undue burden of constantly referring to the notes. In addition, the series of maps at the end of the book was immensely helpful.Traditional historians tend to take a serious and rigid position on their view of history as if it's the only perspective. Recently, some historians have tried to open up this narrow scope and try to interpret history from different points of view and have proclaimed their approach \"new history\". But Herodotus had beaten them to it because that's exactly what his Histories did.Even though he was writing for the Greeks, he showed great appreciation and understanding of Egyptian history and culture and often gave Egypt credit for many ideas and inventions later given to the Greeks. He also showed remarkable respect for their archenemy the Persians. In fact, a lot of our information of the early Achaemenids came from his writings. His open-mindedness and international outlook is astonishing. However, he couldn't resist giving Greek ancestors to the non-Greeks. Thus the Persians were descended from Perseus, the Medians from Medea, and the Egyptians from Io.Even though Herodotus lived in a city sponsored by Athens during the Peloponnesian Wars, he didn't seem to like the Athenians very much and praised the Spartans very generously. He tried to give dues and disclose warts when he talked about the conflicts between Greek city-states, personal vendettas among the leaders, reasons for frequent defections, and the wide spread collaborations between the Greeks and the Persians throughout this period. Not surprisingly, even though the Spartans helped the Athenians defeat the Persians in this round, two generations later, the Persians helped the Spartans defeat the Athenians.As this was a time before the fanatical intolerant monotheism took over the region and religious tolerance was the norm, Herodotus told the readers \"their Zeus is called XXX \" or \"their religious rite is similar to our XXX\" to relate foreign practices to Greek understanding. However, he wisely and steadfastly refused to engage in religious discussions beyond the necessary mentions of it as part of the cultural and political practice because he deemed it outside his chosen topics of history, geography, and culture.Some scholars complained that his writing was rambling but I find it very natural. He introduced each player when it was appropriate in the story and not before. He revealed each people, their history, their location, their customs, and their achievements as the flow of storytelling required.  By disclosing their origins and struggles, he gave roots to their unique culture and made their way of life reasonable and understandable. He was a master storyteller who knew when and how to take excursions and when and how to get back on track. With imperceptible forward momentum, he unrolled the story slowly and even-handedly towards its dramatic climax.Herodotus sprinkled a lot of traditional oriental wisdom, as dispensed by various wise men from different race, throughout the book. But it's often the small anecdotes which are most intriguing and lighten the reading. And some of the passing remarks are more than first meets the eyes. For example, his observation that the Egyptians had thick skulls because they shaved their heads and the Persians had thin skulls because they had long hair and wore felt hats is unexpectedly modern understanding of vitamin D from the sun thickens bones. And the bit about Xerxes' uncle explaining that dreams are not messages from gods but things we have been concerned about during the day is also surprisingly modern Jungian.Most impressively, he did not insist on his point of view. He shared other perspectives and other interpretations equally, even those information and stories he did not find credible. As he said \"I am obliged to record the things I am told but I am not required to believe them.\" He trusted the readers to make their own choice among various versions.  Some scholarly historians called this gossiping, but I thought it was respect for the readers. After all, there are many sides to every person, many facets to every event, and many explanations to every outcome.Even though the West has taken the position that the Greeks had won because of the naval victory at Salamis, it was not so simple. Considering that the Persians had demolished Attica and burned Athens, and considering that Xerxes returned home when winter was coming, one could conclude that the Persian's expedition to punish Athens for helping the Ionians and for burning Sardis was mission accomplished. Besides, Persia was never a sea power like the Greeks were anyway. So, win or lose, it all depends on the spin!On the other hand, Herodotus did have the advantage of living in a highly cultured and civilized world of Eastern Mediterranean and was writing for a sophisticated and educated readership.  Later scholarly historians didn't have his advantage because they were living in the Western Mediterranean world after the onset of the devastating Dark Age and after it was under the intolerant grip of Christianity. Besides, his gift for storytelling is unique even among fiction writers much less among historians.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Far Away and Long Ago Came Alive!", "unixReviewTime": 1388793600, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2014"}

Beautiful.Okay, now that I got that out of my system, let me just say that this was not what I was expecting AT ALL. The writing was beautiful. Lauren's inner monologues were beautifully written, although this girl annoyed me to no end. But I love characters who frustrate me. Isn't that the point? As the reader, I have the foresight/foreknowledge that Lauren doesn't so my frustrations with her weren't because she wasn't likable. I was frustrated because I was able to see the disaster coming (although, I COMPLETELY wasn't expecting it to be what it was) and she couldn't.I tried, but I just couldn't get myself to like Cal. Even after his whole secret was revealed, it didn't change how utterly repulsed I was by the way he treated Lauren. And then Lauren frustrated me further by defending him. By waiting for him. By putting her life on hold for him.She and Caylen deserve so much better. In the sequel, I really hope she and Chris get to know each other and fall for one another somehow, some way. I don't know why I feel that way since we didn't get to read much about Chris. I just do. Hopefully we'll have more insight into who he is in the next book.The suspense element of this story had me flipping pages and reading until the wee hours of the morning.

I had to see what would happen and what it would take for Mitch to come around and do right by Paige and his daughter.This book takes place approximately 7 months from the conclusion of the first novella. Believe it or not Mitch has not been home since he left and it takes a threatening document to stir him in to action.When back in town he wastes no time trying to establish a relationship with his daughter. Paige initially is shocked, then angered, then finds herself melting under the charms of Mitch. It is obvious the two still have feelings for each other.Both families have been very supportive of Paige and Bree. Everyone except Diane is leery of Mitch's actions regarding Paige. As one would guess the two find their way back to each other.I want to state that I love Kendall's writing and I was anxiously awaiting this book. Mitch does truly seem remorseful but I can't say I am happy with the ending. He screwed up in a major way, HUGE. I am ok with him trying to establish a relationship with Bree, but I cannot see how Paige gets past the abysmal way he treated her. Even when trying to work hard to get her back, the only thing that is conveyed crystal clear is his attraction and desire for Paige. Everything is very physical. His actions with Bree obviously are great but I don't see how he made any amends to Paige. Humbling himself with her family and Erin seemed inadequate and I really wish Paige sought something better.Then the crazy twist at the end, I knew something was fishy but I didn't have any clue it was gonna go down like it did. Not sure how I feel about that as it was thrown in last minute and not really dealt with. I am curious to read the next book however to see what happens between Josh and Erin.So overall, great writing, good story and characters which are believable.

I would recommend reading the other two books first since Pesh Nadeem appears in The Proposal, so the story makes more sense if you know his background. Megan McKenzie is a single mom who is in the final stages of becoming a registered nurse. She hasn't dated since her son's father left her when she found out she was pregnant. Pesh is an ER doctor who hasn't dated seriously since the death of his wife years ago. You would think they would want the same thing in a relationship...love and commitment, but you would be very wrong. Megan wants a hot fling, and Pesh wants to settle down and give love another try. They are both chosen as godparents to Aidan and Emma's son, Noah. Pesh is a great friend to them, and Megan is Aidan's niece. When they meet at the baptism, there is an immediate attraction between the two, but it's going to be a battle of the wills to see which one gets their way, a relationship or just hot, smoldering sex! Megan leaves the reception with Pesh after she has too much to drink, and she thinks she will be having a night of hot sex with the sexy doctor, but things don't turn out quite like she had hoped. The two go their separate ways the next morning, but fate isn't through with these two, Megan is assigned to Pesh's ER to finish her final clinicals several months later. Let the games begin again...you'll have to read on to see if Megan or Pesh win.I have read the other two books in the series and loved them. I know reading reviews from other readers that many of them didn't like Pesh in The Proposal because they thought he was trying to take Emma away from Aidan. However, I have always been a fan of Pesh's. Who wouldn't be! He's sexy as hell, a successful doctor, a truly honorable soul, and again did I mention sexy as hell? He falls for Megan hard the first time he sees her and cannot forget about her. Megan is a firecracker. If you read any of the other books, you know she takes after her Uncle Aidan. She and Pesh are truly opposites who complement each other nicely. Megan brings out the spontaneous side of Pesh, and he brings out the softer side of her. There are many scenes that include Megan's toddler son, Mason. Those were some of the most heart-warming scenes to me, especially the one near the end of the book when they are eating dinner with Megan's family. Much of the story is about Pesh's pursuit of Megan and trying to get her to give him a chance at a real relationship. The sexy stuff doesn't happen until at least mid-way through the book, but it was well worth the wait. Katie knows how to write a sexy love scene!One of my favorite things about this book is that I got to see how Aidan, Emma, and many of the other characters are doing.

They rushed to his beside when they found out he was in a coma, brought in some phenomenal specialist doctor to work with him, then just peaced out and were never heard from again. Emma didn't bother to inform him that they had been there, nor did he bother to ask, and also, nobody bothered to even freakin' tell them that he was awake and at home, and his parents didn't even bother to so much as call to check on him either!!4) Emma was harboring so much hurt & resentment towards William through most of the book, and then *BAM* like the flip of a switch she's.over.it.and.they're.getting.married.THE.END there was no actual working through her hurt, no communication, openness, honesty. So now they got their &#34;HEA&#34; that seems doomed because their whole relationship is based on lies & deceit between 2 people who are trying too hard to be what they think that the other wants, rather than being who they really are.With all that being said, the series was good, and had TONS of potential for greatness, but the last 2 books were just too rushed and had too many holes in the plot.Also, I would have very much preferred to read the 2 books together, just written as 1 book, done in alternating POV's.Wow, that was really long winded, if you've stuck it out and are still reading this, thank you!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "SO.MUCH.POTENTIAL!", "unixReviewTime": 1402099200, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2014"}

What will come of all the friendships? What will happen to Mira and Danny's relationship?  Will these four people find their happiness?&#34;...You have no idea how much I love you. You're my moon, my stars, and my universe...&#34;Ashley Suzanne had me with Mirage. I fell in love with a story and a group of incredible characters.  I was left on the edge of my seat wanting to know what will happen next. And as much as I want to know , I'm happy she took the time to give us Danny's POV.  You learn a lot more about Danny and Mira's relationship in this novella.  But you also get an understanding of how close Mira and Skylar become as well. I can not wait to read Awakening and see what happens next with these four amazing characters.

We can be fluid, flexible when we have to be. But strong and destructive too. And something else, I think to myself. Like water, we mostly follow the path of least resistance.&#8221;Seeing as Wally Lamb is my favorite author I was extra excited to read this book. It definitely did not disappoint. On the surface, this is a story of a broken marriage. Of a wife and mother of three who leaves her husband for another woman. If you have read some of his previous works, you already know that there is going to be so much more to the story. Pour yourself a large glass of red wine and keep the bottle nearbyThere are so many heavy issues that are dealt with in this story, divorce, sexual abuse, loss of a parent, alcoholism, the list goes on. I know this makes it sound like a depressing story but it&#8217;s not all bad. The real heart of the story is learning to cope with what life has given you and making the most of it. Buy another bottle of wine.The thing I love the most about his novels is the way everything is so layered. You have to pay attention to things that may seem insignificant at the time as it will certainly come full circle in the end. There is always some intertwined story that seems to not have anything to do with the rest until the end. This is not to say that everything gets tied up and placed in a nice package with a bow on it. Many things are just inferred and if you haven&#8217;t been paying attention you will miss out on these gifts.Annie Oh is an artist, a mother, and an ex wife and is about to be remarried. To a woman. Her husband Orion is left to deal with not only being left but being left for another woman. Their children are also forced to deal with aftermath of her decisions. Annie also has secrets from her childhood that have shaped everything she has ever done in her adult life. Things she has never shared with anyone. Not even her husband or her soon to be wife. Of course this only begins to scratch the surface of the entire plot of the story.This novel reminds me of the concept of the butterfly effect. One small action effects so many things. It is not until the end that we learn what started everything. I can honestly say there is not one thing I disliked about this story.

Many of the ingredients in recipes were also other recipes from the book, so for instance a chicken recipe may have 12 ingredients, one of which is bacon aioli which is 8 ingredients and another is cauliflower rice which is time consuming as well.I also wasn't crazy about the type of recipes.

Its a romance, and also a puzzle with danger coming to Kate along with the solution.I liked Kate, she's mum to her dead sister's child, and she and Jamie have carved out a contented life for themselves. Then their world is turned upside down when tabloid papers print a story over Jamie being local hero and rugby player Lane's son. Of course as always they're not interested in the truth &#8211; just want scandal for the ratings. Kate is bombarded with Press at her home, Lane completely blind sided by the fact he may have a ten year old child, and Jamie struggling with insecurity wondering if he'll be taken from Kate...Kate's firm and insistent, nothing will take him away from her, though she's willing to let Lane build a relationship with him.Along the journey to the truth there's  a potential kidnapping, danger and attacks on Kate&#8217;s home and business, and threats to her safety. Lane steps up his protection of her and gradually falls in love. He just needs to persuade Jamie and Kate that they should be a family.Its a fun romance with a snippet of danger, not heart stopping but a more subtle kind that creeps up quietly and lands with a bang. The police were great characters too, becoming regular visitors.

The first of which is the fact that the author, Magdalen Nabb, passed away in 2007 and it is an opportunity to continue having her work presented to a new legion of readers.The second reason is the recent revival in this true crime cold case that has brought about a non-fiction novel (with the same title) that was co-written by Douglas Preston and Mario Spezi.  That book has garnered interest from Hollywood and a film is speculated to be made starring George Clooney in the role of Doug Preston!The Monster Of Florence was the Jack the Ripper of Italy having been charged with seven double homicides between 1968 and 1985. There were many other murders that could have possibly been committed by this individual but local law enforcement has been unable to prove any of that.  Actually, they have not been able to prove anything and this remains the most infamous cold case in Italian history.Along comes Magdalen Nabb attempting to put a fictional spin on this case.  Her recurring crime series that featured Marshal Guarnaccia is the perfect outlet for a speculative novel about the famed Monster of Florence.  Like the actual officials following this case, Guarnaccia seems to be foiled at every turn and is surprised when his Director assigns him the task of reopening an old cold case such as this one.The novel contains many court transcripts and internal communications that reviewed the various suspects in this case --- and there are a lot of them.  Nabb blends both fictional and non-fictional suspects to present a case for Guarnaccia that appears overwhelming for anyone to solve.If readers have read the non-fiction novel by Preston & Spezi they will realize how inept, corrupt and misguided the Italian law enforcement and legal communities were in regards to this case.  Preston and Spezi themselves were even detained and briefly accused of being the Monster themselves!  A frustrating endeavor for anyone seeking to bring clarity and understanding to this case.THE MONSTER OF FLORENCE provides a lot of technical detail that at times bogs down the action and pace of the novel.  The main enjoyment in reading a novel like this rests in having an understanding of the actual case it was based on and appreciating the attempt to shine some light on a dark chapter in Italian history.Reviewed by Ray Palen for New Mystery Reader", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fictional take on an infamous Italian cold case.", "unixReviewTime": 1389225600, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2014"}

It's wonderfully illustrated, there's enough colour and pictures interspersed throughout to appeal to younger ages, but not to the point of being extremely juvenile so it can grow with them. This is a full version of the Bible, in the New International Readers Version (NIrV) which is a translation that uses contemporary english. I find it similar to the NIV.This Bible is hardcover, which is a big plus for durability. We have had one or two other Junior Bibles around here and the soft cover ones do not stand up well to regular use and going back and forth to church. The pages aren't super thin, I don't think they'll be likely to rip and the print doesn't leak right through making it hard to read. That seems to be a problem with some other children's Bibles because they are trying to do things cheap. Not a problem here. The only negative I have about this particular Bible is the lenticular picture on the front of the bible, the ribbed 3D kind of thing. I think it makes it look younger than it's really geared for and the age that would be ready for a full Bible. Besides that, young boys love scratching their nails across it!Overall, this is a great Bible choice for a boy or girl who is ready for a full Bible instead of a Bible story book. It's already got my 7 year old reading bits and pieces in his new Bible instead of feeling like it's way out of his league.

BETTER HOMES & HAUNTINGS is a departure from Harper&#8217;s normal vampires, werewolves, and witches, but it doesn&#8217;t suffer for it. In fact, this standalone was  a treat, and definitely worth the read despite my complaints about tropes.There were some truly creepy moments in BETTER HOMES & HAUNTINGS. Between the ghostly experiences, plus the &#8220;trapped on an island&#8221; plotline, there&#8217;s almost a horror movie feel in the background. I appreciated that the ghosts were scary, because the last paranormal romance with ghosts I read, the ghost was the heroine, and it just doesn&#8217;t seem right. Creepy ghosts are much more like it.My one complaint was the real-life bad guy. I think the book could have done without that addition, since there was already enough tension with the ghost story and trying to figure that out. Plus, the story was unique, and the addition of the stalker ex-boyfriend made it feel, at times, a little formulaic. I could easily see this novel without the ghosts being a standalone contemporary romance novel, so anything that made it feel more that way was a downside, in my opinion.All in all, BETTER HOMES & HAUNTINGS was classic Molly Harper, with laughs and romance and just enough paranormal to round it out. While it isn&#8217;t my favorite Harper, it definitely stands on its own merit, and since it isn&#8217;t a series, there really isn&#8217;t much investment required (though I wouldn&#8217;t mind a book about some of the other characters&#8230;).I would recommend it to anybody looking for a fun, creative romance read.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Standard romance tropes make this not the best Harper, but fun nonetheless", "unixReviewTime": 1404691200, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2014"}

She has a murder to solve and somehow the past all comes together. The answer to the present is in the past.Now at times I got confused because the author would use the last names of the officers and prosecutor. I don't like being confused in a story hence the 4 star rating.Rebecka has to deal with a young and upcoming prosecutor who wants to push her off the case. But Rebecka takes it all into her own hands but what price does she pay?With this murder happening, Rebecka takes a look back at the family's past and notices more &#34;accidents&#34; have happened.Along with this book taking place in the present we are also taken back into the 1900's where all this pretty much started.

The book begins with Meg Elginbrodde and Geoffrey Levett in a taxi.  Levett is a wealthy businessman, used to getting what he wants and he is desperately in love with Meg and intends to marry her.  The problem is that since their engagement was announced, Meg has been receiving photographs from her husband - who she believed had died in the war.  She has turned to Campion and Detective Chief Inspector Charles Luke for advice, when a meeting is proposed between her and her former husband. The man she glimpses across the fog bound platform of a station is certainly not her husband, but the mystery deepens after he is questioned and released.What follows is an extremely atmospheric mystery;  set in a post-war, weary London in a middle of a pea souper fog.  As events escalate, Levett goes missing and witnesses are killed.  A convict called Jack Havoc has escaped from prison &#8211; he is hunting a &#8220;treasure&#8221;, while Luke and Campion search for him in the &#8220;Smoke,&#8221; which is the fog bound city of London.  There are some wonderful characters, such as the saintly Canon Avril, the brilliantly named Tiddy Doll and the elusive Havoc himself &#8211; the Tiger of the story.I had only read one Campion novel before and I found myself a little lost so far into the series, as obviously you were meant to know some familiar characters.  However, Campion himself did not feature strongly in the book, meaning that it worked quite well as a stand-alone story.  London itself &#8211; battered, weary, down at heel &#8211; is almost a character in itself.  Everyone stumbles around, unable to see and events are revealed slowly, almost as glimpses through the fog.  If you are interested in London shortly after the war, then this novel gives you a great view of the City at that time and is worth reading just for the historical aspect of the book.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Tiger in the Smoke", "unixReviewTime": 1399766400, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2014"}

The Heroine, Charli, is likeable, feisty and challenging.  Thed Hero, Grant.....well....what can I say......a great Dom.  I could not wait to read Grant's story.  His appearances in the other two books had me wanting to read about THE man....the owner of the club.  Owners of a BDSM club is always my favorite Doms.  Once again, this book actually had an interesting storyline that went with the book well and not page after page of BDSM sex.  Don't get me wrong, I like erotic books but some books like Fifty Shades was way over the top in sex scenes which became page turners.  It is a very romantic book and when you finally hear all of Grant's story, you are pulled into his sadness because his love, his wife, his mate, was so great.  You also felt sorry for Charli because she loved him so much but would not settle for nothing less than a true relationship.  Now....what I did not like in this book is that the BDSM scenes seemed a little bit more darker than what I am use to.  Usually, it is someone else in the club who is receiving the beatings and the two main characters observe.  Not this book and she gets beaten hard.....not spanked with the hand (but that happens too by someone else because Grant is sharing????)  I do not care for where the Sub gets beaten so hard that she cannot lie on her back because it is so sore.  I guess I am old school and I am not into being shared.  If I am a Sub, I sub for only one person and that would go on the List.  Of course, in this book, that is somehow forgotten.  I also do not care for two guys on one girl at the same time and it seems to happen in the &#34;A Loving on the Edge Novels.&#34;  I am just not into that and I cannot see a person who is new at this sort of life would like it either.  My feathers get sort of ruffled when the beatings over something so minor occurs.  This feminist does not care for that, and I cringe when the scene is played out.  Of course, the writer happens to write that the Sub is a feminist but somehow she puts her feelings aside when being dealt with when she has done something wrong, which to me, is such a small thing.  I have no problems with bondage, the scenes, the displaying of the Sub in a scene for all to see, but it is really hard to get past the beatings.  That is something too dark for me.  I prefer Doms who are not into that sort of thing as well.  But all in all, I did give this book five stars because I love how Mrs. Loren writes, and I did not want to give it four stars simply because I shy away from beatings and it seems that others like it.  She makes her Doms very appealing and one cannot help but like her Subs.  As I stated earlier, I love owners of BDSM clubs.  They are the most interesting and the erotic scenes are fantastic.  Do I recommend this book, you bet.  Just be prepared for the more darker side of BDSM.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "There is not much to not like in this book", "unixReviewTime": 1401408000, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2014"}

But when Ashling and her mother get there they learn that he intends to marry her off, even though she is only 14.  Ashling and her mother protest, but it is Ashling's brother who persuades their father to let Ashling wait a few more years before she is to be married to her intended.  A few years pass and Ashling and her mother are found by their pack's enemy.  They run back to her father for protection and it's decided that Ashling should go into hiding with Baran, a sort of lone wolf.  While living with him she meets Grey.  He's not a werewolf but there is something about him that she can't put her finger on, plus she is very interested in him.  Grey reciprocates the attraction, but many obstacles stand in the way of their happy ever after.This story started out great and kept me interested.  It's definitely unique compared to other werewolf stories I've read.  I was a little turned off that Ashling was only 14 at first; I thought I was going to have to read about a 14 year old, but then in the next chapter, a few years pass, so that was good news for me.Ashling is a headstrong female.  She doesn't let anyone, including her father tie her down.  Basically, she does what she wants.  She had great character traits, but I still had a little trouble feeling connected to her.Let's talk about chemistry between Ashling and Grey.  I could tell the attraction was immediate; but for the rest of their relationship I just felt like something was missing.  I can't put my finger on it though.  I honestly didn't care if they were together or not.  I didn't feel the love as much as they were saying it to each other.The story kept me very interested in the beginning, then I did get a little bored towards the middle, but the ending picked up again and I really couldn't put it down.  All in all, Bloodmark was a good book.  And the bonus is that it's the first book of a series.

Hagan, Jr. I&#8217;m a fan of the 1997 movie about the ill-fated ship and I&#8217;ve seen the movie many times. Because of that, I was immediately drawn to the book&#8217;s title. After I finished reading Hagan&#8217;s book, I can easily say that the author delivers on his promise to motivate, challenge, and empower his readers. He made an excellent choice for a topic. The book&#8217;s cover art alone is intriguing. Even though I&#8217;ve read some other books about the Titanic, I learned some new information here that I didn&#8217;t know. The author has obviously done his homework.I LOVED the poem from Dr. Benjamin Mayes that is on the back cover. I&#8217;d never read that before. There&#8217;s an important lesson in those rhymes that all of us can benefit from. I think it was very appropriate to feature it in this book.The author poses many thought-provoking questions. For instance, if you were among the over fifteen-hundred passengers on that ocean liner and you knew the end of your life was at hand, would you have lived your life differently?  Whoa, reality check! Our lives can be over in the blink of an eye. We get so tied up and self-absorbed at times that we can miss some of the warning signs of danger ahead. Sometimes it takes a Titanic-sized event in our own lives for us to pay attention to what&#8217;s really going on around us.  Perfect peace can only be found through God alone and His gift is there for all of us.  That some choose to reject or ignore the gift is one of the consequences of sin in a fallen world.The writing is good and the book is easy to read. I liked the format a lot &#8211; references at the bottom, fascinating trivia, historical facts, effective use of bold type, historical drawings and photos.  Most importantly, the scriptures the author chose to accompany his work are right on point in my opinion. The lesson titles are aptly named and I appreciated his modern-day parallels. There were a few minor grammar issues, but I didn&#8217;t see anything huge. There was also one confusing sentence for me with some awkward wording. Other than that, I was engaged and eager to read the whole book.There are so many takeaways. One of my favorite lines: &#8220;That we need to be grateful for every moment that we spend on earth.&#8221; Amen to that! I think this book would appeal to a vast audience, Christians and also Non-Christians looking for perspective on the trials of life.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well Done", "unixReviewTime": 1401667200, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2014"}

Instead of the usual ultra-brave heroine and hero fighting against the evil Nazis in any way they can; we have Beth, a Quaker pacifist, and Josef, a doctor in the German army who happens to believe in the Germany he remembers from childhood.After reading several WWII fiction books that mostly center in the U.S., England, or France, it was nice to read a slightly different view of things in Germany and of the many German's that fought against Hitler's regime in a myriad of ways.One of the fascinating things about the book is all of the Quaker beliefs and methods that are key to the story and how certain characters act. I knew almost nothing about the Society Of Friends, they are a little-written-about group, and so the fact that this story centers around a Quaker girl and some of her family and friends made this story even more interesting for me.The author does an excellent job of immersing the reader in WWII era Munich. I could see everything so clearly in my mind's eye. I felt like I was walking the streets of the city with Beth and Josef, stepping inside the apartment with Uncle Franz and Aunt Ilse, hiding in the basement from falling bombs with Liesl.The last third of the book did seem a bit hurried to me, causing the historical detail and character emotions to take a little dip.That aside, All God's Children was very enjoyable and I will definitely be looking forward to the release of the next book in this series, Simple Faith.The combination of setting the story in a  little used WWII location, the Quaker pacifism, (old) German patriotism, detail in locations, interesting characters, and just the history, make this a great book for lovers of Historical fiction.(I received a copy of this book from the publisher through The Book Club Network in exchange for my honest review.

She wants to add another dimension to that image, and makes some odd choices in what she writes about, the most talked-about being her obsession with sex, and that mars the book.

No hesitation. I love that True was more than it seems from the description, that it wasn't simply the story of the bad boy and the virgin. It wasn't a sexual awakening or frivolous at all. True is a love story, pure and simple, of a two people who are near opposites, but fit together so very perfectly.Tyler and Rory were not one-dimensional characters, defined by the sexuality or social standing. They both held many layers, and that complexity really bonded me to both. Tyler grew up in such turmoil, and works so hard to keep his brothers together. He wants more out of life, but doesn't know that he'll ever get it. Tyler has a tough exterior, but is vulnerable with Rory. He's cocky, yet not really conceited. He was brave, yet scared to give his heart to a woman whom he deems too good for him. I loved that he loved Rory exactly as she was.Though I couldn't find any of myself in Rory, I connected with her deeply. I would say that is testament to McCarthy's ability to bring these characters off the page, make me love them. Rory was...she was just Rory. Logical to a fault, quiet and unassuming, always withholding herself and her emotions. I loved who Rory became with Tyler. That she wasn't afraid to push him, question him, and love him. Once Rory decided to open up to Tyler, it was like she became a better version of herself. She was still way literal, but she also joked more. Hugged more, allowed people to truly know her.Oh gosh, I sound like a sap. And I am one when it comes to books such as this. I think what I love about this series is that it is just so real. The characters don't come packaged with the right words or decisions, they mess up and they grovel and they learn and grow. That sort of experience is what I love so much about reading.There was a moment in True that struck me hard, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. It's when Tyler and Rory are discussing Streetcar Named Desire, and Rory just can't understand why these characters are behaving so illogically...&#34;If they would just communicate with each other, they could resolve all their issues in ten minutes.&#34;&#34;That's what makes the book so realistic,&#34; he told me dryly. &#34;Real people don't discuss this shit with each other.&#34;He had a point. I didn't really discuss my emotions with anyone either. I had spent most of my life being a silent observer. &#34;Oh.&#34;In one fell swoop, I got it. Literature wasn't intended to be about perfect people, it was about flaws, very real and very deep human flaws.That is an excellent reminder, I think.If you're looking for a deep, intense, sexy and fun New Adult series, True Believers is, without a doubt, one of my favorites.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm a Believer", "unixReviewTime": 1404086400, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2014"}

While she knows there has been destruction of personal items or the items have been stolen, Charlotte has promised her father she will again try to raise the rice crop and live on the land.The paragraph above states the setting of the fictional tale that is actually based on a real historical figure named Elizabeth Waties Allston Pringle.  Can you imagine what this woman witnessed in her lifetime?  How about thinking of what her life was like before and after the Civil War?  Charlotte is based loosely on the real life experiences of Elizabeth, and the author, with some minor adaptations, places her novel near where the real plantation where Elizabeth lived.  After you read the fictional tale, the author shares how she came to learn about this unique woman and her life.There are characters that portray what southern people must have felt during Reconstruction along with what many veterans suffered during a horrific war.  They had to learn to live in a new society that was still forming.  With so few eligible men to marry, we see a jealous female antagonist see that she indeed ends up with the one man she sets her eyes on no matter who gets hurt in reaching her goal.  Yellow fever is an epidemic that costs many lives in New Orleans in 1868.  With the destruction so complete, few can prove they own the land on which they return to.Dorothy Love writes a moving masterpiece that keeps the reader reading until they see how the unknown ending is revealed.  I simply cannot express how much the real woman Elizabeth, along with others who lived in the south before, during and after the war, had to learn how to start all over.  Readers see how a woman who has her faith shredded by heartbreak learns to trust God again in a time when each day brings new trials, triumphs or tragedy.  What a tenacity people displayed to endure and then to thrive each day.  Perhaps like our female lead character they did so by looking to God and putting one foot in front of the other time and time again.

His answer is that we often misinterpret underdogs, and that because of their experience and circumstances underdogs tend to be tenacious, play by their own rules, and are cunning.  Then there's the problem of authority, which in its often expression and extension of its strength over-estimates the enemy and degrades its own authority.For loyal readers of Malcolm Gladwell, and I certainly count myself as one of them, &#34;David and Goliath&#34; is a sure letdown from Gladwell at his peak (&#34;Outliers&#34;).  The beauty and facility of his prose are still there, but his thinking -- never his strength -- has become muddied and muddled.  He has a habit of making points that are entirely obvious, and sometimes even making points that have no basis in reality.  For example, in one chapter on academic achievement, Gladwell assumes that every student at Harvard wants to study STEM, and if they switch from STEM to arts it's become they couldn't hack it.  And what is his advice to make sure that America produces enough STEM talent?  Encourage top-performing high school students to apply to less prestigious institutions, where they will become a big fish in a small pond and not become lost and insecure as a small fish in a big pond.That argument is intuitive, but Gladwell has a bad habit of trying to wrap his intuitive arguments under the cloak of scientific rigor, and so what often happens is that when you pull the cloak away there's really nothing there at all.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "The Advantages of Disadvantages, and the Disadvantages of Advantages", "unixReviewTime": 1390348800, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2014"}

It's in a genre I don't normally choose, but good writing will suck me in every time and I thought Dana Reinhardt did a fabulous job giving life and voice to the Golden sisters.We didn't need anybody else.  But more than that,we were better  without anybody else.The story is about Nell and Layla, their family and friends. They are sisters who are very, very close. Layla's the older sister. She's one of those girls whose life seems charmed. She's smart, talented, loving and athletic. A sensible teen who has her act together. Nell is her little sister. Nell appears to be every bit as gifted and smart as her sister, but she's at an age and a place in her life where she can't see that yet. And for the time being she's in Layla's shadow. But she's okay with that. She loves Layla fiercely.I'll probably always remember where I was andwhat I wore and all that, it was that kind of moment.I could no longer pretend.Something was happening.Something that shouldn't be.And I had absolutely no idea what to do.WE ARE THE GOLDENS is about love and betrayal and the basic human condition. Our inability, on the one hand, to see our own doom racing towards us. And our total freaking cluelessness as to what to do when we see disaster poised to strike someone we love.~This book worked for me on so many levels. The writing was excellent. Nell's voice was a perfect blend of intelligence and innocence. It made her dilemmas believable. I also loved Nell's relationship with Felix, her BFF. Adorable isn't strong enough a word.What I don't understand was Dana Reinhardt's having Nell converse with the dead boys. They were probably there to underscore some subtle point, but I wasn't smart enough to figure it out.I don't have a lot of books in my repertoire to compare this to.  But if you enjoyed  Swati Avasthi's SPLIT, or  Francisco Stork's LAST SUMMER OF THE DEATH WARRIORS, or even Green's FAULT IN OUR STARS, you might want to pick this up.I think the 'undetermined' ending is going to throw some readers.

To me, it's shocking that almost no mainstream doctors and so few \"experts\", much less writers of books like this, are aware that fibromyalgia is a symptom of low thyroid (hypothyroid). Shocking.There are no lab tests for many causes of low thyroid, so at least 80% of us are mis-diagnosed, because your doctor will only treat lab tests, not you. The FREE basal (at rest) temperature self-test is THE gold standard for low thyroid problems and - with your symptoms - means more than any lab test (although most conventional doctors, including endos, won't agree but then they're not trained to understand thyroid problems - go to the Broda Barnes foundation website and click on the \"Educational Info\" button on the left for how to get a list of thyroid-sympathetic doctors in your state.(I'd always suspected a thyroid problem but it was not until, after 20 years of being told all my lab tests were \"normal\", that a Broda Barnes trained doctor finally put me on the road to recovery. A year after I insisted my cousin also see this doctor, she said I'd saved her life.)The basal temperature home self-test will pick up conditions that current lab tests don't, such as thyroid resistance. Most digital thermometers are not accurate so find a good basal digital thermometer, the kind used by women to identify their fertile days.The stopthethyroidmadness website has excellent instructions for this self-test, as well as several for adrenal fatigue, which often goes hand-in-hand with low thyroid. The two most common health problems worldwide, they're rarely diagnosed or treated.I also suggest:- \"The Metabolic Treatment of Fibromyalgia\" by Lowe, a very expensive medical book of more than 1,000 pages, essentially explaining how fibromyalgia is successfully treated with thyroid supplements;- `Hypothyroidism Type 2' by Mark Starr (\"type 2\" meaning the thyroid problems for which there are no lab tests and therefore they don't get diagnosed) explains how all chronic pain is linked to low thyroid, including those involved with fibromyalgia, diabetes, heart problems, both bleeding & blood clots (including strokes) and some cancers. If you have any kind of chronic pain, you need to know that some are calling low thyroid the silent epidemic (silent because officially denied);- \"Hypothyroidism, Health & Happiness: The Riddle of Illness Revealed\" by Steven F. Hotze a good introduction;- As there is rarely more than a brief mention of the benefits of iodine in thyroid books, I also suggest \"Iodine, Why You Need It and Why You Can't Live Without It\" by David Brownstein MD. The latest edition is available as an ebook from drbrownstein[dot]directfrompublisher[dot]comAlso, those with fibromyalgia experience a significant reduction in their symptoms when taking a melatonin supplement and melatonin can reduce some symptoms of IBS, such as abdominal pain. Melatonin increases the conversion of precursor thyroid hormone T4 to the active T3 form. It can reactivate the important but much-ignored thymus gland, which degenerates almost completely over the years. It also improves zinc absorption, which in turn boosts several immune functions. Melatonin therapy also helps spleen recovery, another immune-system component which declines with age. Its ability to improve sleep and dreaming is a tremendous boon to memory. It is one of the most powerful antioxidants made by the body.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "nothing works long-term, until you address the real cause", "unixReviewTime": 1403049600, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2014"}

He&#8217;s an only child, however, and his foreman is always harping that Walker needs an heir. He&#8217;s young and healthy, though, so he&#8217;s in no hurry, until a bull almost kills him. Since he can&#8217;t bring himself to court again, he makes arrangements for a mail order bride.Sarah Livingston&#8217;s father just doesn&#8217;t understand how much she wants a husband and children of her own, and he doesn&#8217;t think anyone is good enough, unless it&#8217;s a man who doesn&#8217;t want to marry her. When her father decides to send her to Uncle Brice&#8217;s in Georgia after her last escapade, she knows she&#8217;ll have to do something desperate. She decides to run to her friend in New York, but, on the way, she meets a young woman crying because she has to become a mail order bride. Sarah switches places with her, and when she meets Walker, she knows she did the right thing. Can she put off telling him the truth long enough to make him fall in love with her? As she tries, things become more and more complicated and messy.For the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Sarah is stubborn but lovable, because she has a big heart and wants to do the right thing, even when she makes bad choices. Walker is just as stubborn in his own way, and I could understand why he was leery of being deceived. Some of the things that happened with Caleb wasn&#8217;t rational, and I was surprised Sarah ran away when she had promised Walker she wouldn&#8217;t. The cover of the book is also wrong, because Sarah was a redhead.

Will is Hannah&#8217;s brother&#8217;s best friend from childhood. They haven&#8217;t seen each other in years, but Hannah decides to catch up with Will again for old time sake. Hannah is no longer the young, little sister Will is use to seeing and when Hannah asks Will for sex advice, he can&#8217;t deny her.I liked Will in Beautiful Stranger and he is even better in Beautiful Player. I also like how nerdy Hannah is. They become friends and bond over jogging in the mornings. It&#8217;s really cute seeing Will train Hannah and help her with her love life. Hannah isn&#8217;t a virgin, but she is differently not experienced. Chole and Sara from Beautiful Bastard and Beautiful Stranger, give Hannah a little make-over to get her up to par with the dating world.Hannah goes on a few dates and Will coaches her on how to act and what is appropriate and not appropriate behavior. Hannah has no filter and is really easy going with Will. I love this! She asks him random things, like if girls really do make the sounds she hears from watching porn.

I've begun to notice a pattern, however, which doesn't always work. Towards the end of the story, the guy has some sort of crisis, breaks off the blossoming romance in a particularly hurtful way; she gets surrounded by her friends usually bearing margaritas; and then he comes back with his tail between his legs and humbly asks her back in a way that will be public or involve multiple other people. She immediately jumps into his arms and the book ends.  Its a formula that is started to make me roll my eyes, especially in this story due to the fact that Jack is extremely cruel to those around him there at the end. His redemption within the eyes of his friends and Larissa happens so fast, one starts to think the author ran up against a page length issue. In Fool's Gold, men get to be jerks - publically -  and women love them unconditionally. Redemption and forgiveness happens to two pages or less.And so these stories become fairy tales as opposed to a warm window into the heart of how complicated love and relationships are.

And somehow she always manages to be wearing the wrong underwear every time it happens&#8230;Wearing a red lace thong while getting arrested isn't really the best option. She meets and falls for a sexy Australian named Wayne but she doesn't feel like he's the boy she should love.

Lola doesn't really know what she wants for the future or how to get it, but along the way she finds that maybe the wrong guy could end up being the right one after all.The name alone should have you intrigued. It did me. It's a cute and funny title to go with a cute and funny book. It hooks you and you can't wait to see how it all ends up. It wasn't really what I expected. I don't think the description does this book justice. I was expecting a light hearted romantic comedy and got so much more. While the book is cute and funny it is also real and has some serious moments.Lola is a great character. She is witty and funny and she makes these hilarious random lists. She is real and flawed beyond belief but you can't help but laugh and cry and prey that she can get it together. And maybe even find her happy ending.There is a bunch of humorous surrounding characters that make you laugh and really feel for all Lola has to put up with. With a bossy, slightly self obsessed; over involved mom and a sister very similar to their mom it makes for a laugh fest. And that is just the beginning of her crazy family and friends.  Wayne is a total boy crush and I kept begging for him to finally get the girl. He is rugged and sexy and oo la la.

She has a positive attitude knowing she&#8217;ll find a solution to her problems especially since worry has never rolled up its sleeves and solved anything. And now, by a fortuitous happenstance she can continue making a difference and spreading cheer after being saved from an encounter with certain death by a stranger.Liam &#8220;Kally&#8221; Kallen has been scarred by his wife&#8217;s death. Not only has his career suffered from it, he is also plagued with a guilt he can hardly talk about much less expunge, tinting his life a dull gray. That is until his concern leads him to save Noelle and his protectiveness guides him to incorporate her into his life. She gives him a new optimistic view and a second chance at love he thought he would never get again.The only problem is Liam and Noelle have too much to give. Liam in the way of material needs and Noelle in terms of positive emotions. Their relationship was too new, moving too fast it&#8217;s overwhelming, forcing Noelle to walk away unless they can find a way to balance their bond.I ached for Liam and his broken soul. Liam made me sympathized with him and his tragic loss. I felt terrible for his misplaced guilt, I understood his confusion over the new opportunity life gave him at a perfect love. He&#8217;s a different kind of take charge heroI enjoyed reading about.I was completely charmed with Noelle&#8217;s character and her desire to do something meaningful with her life. I honestly wish I had that strength of character. But there were also times when my very practical side wanted to slap her and Liam silly for not talking, exploring options and trying to find some kind of middle ground.It&#8217;s really great reading about the previous couples and characters in the team. Their family like bond and their support in this particular book shone through.I was so glad I got to read more about Jamie Babcock, having him living with Kally. He&#8217;s still young enough to be completely cute and adorable but also old enough to be an alpha male with his very own Babs signature.Liam and Noelle&#8217;s story blew me away with the amount of emotions it stirred. A couple of times bringing me to tears. It moved me and left me wanting to make a difference myself.This is the third book in the Portland Storm series. You could probably read it without reading the previous books but you would be missing out on the characters that appear as secondary in this book. I strongly suggest you read the series in order.And for those of you who are Tammy Falkner fans and follow her Reed Brothers series, can you guess where Liam gets his tattoos at?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sweet, sexy and inspiring", "unixReviewTime": 1402876800, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2014"}

{"reviewerID": "A3CPQHC1I7CGVD", "asin": "0316955116", "reviewerName": "Dan Silagi", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "In the spring of 1956, when I was 12 1/2 years old, living in Queens, and finishing the 7th grade (just like Herbie), my parents bought Herman Wouk's \"Marjorie Morningstar,\" and I started reading it.  I found it a bit ponderous, at least for my 12-year-old taste, and my parents thought it might be too \"mature\" for a little kid.  So my mother went to our local library and borrowed \"City Boy,\" telling me I'd love it.She was absolutely right, although I took umbrage at identifying myself as a \"Herbie.\"  Unlike the book's protagonist, I was big and strong for my age and a decent athlete who could hit a baseball a mile (catching it was a different story) and who could take care of himself, so I tried to think of myself as a \"Lennie\" (the big, dumb kid who was Herbie's rival) although I found his character a bit repulsive, as he was a bully and I (generally) wasn't. I paid little attention to the subplot involving Lucille Glass (I wasn't yet interested in girls), and even less to that involving the attempted buyout of \"The Place,\" the ice factory co-owned by Herbie and Lennie's fathers, and by a silent partner, Mr. Powers.  The following year, I went to a sleepaway camp much like Camp Manitou, and with my bunkmates at Bunk 9, put a few of Herbie's ideas into play.  By that time my interest in the opposite sex started to manifest itself.  Did it ever.Recently I bought \"City Boy\" along with \"The Caine Mutiny\" and \"Marjorie Morningstar\" (which my wife is reading for the second time), and I've come to the conclusion that despite the fact that I could hit a spaldeen 3 sewers as a kid, I was very much a Herbie, then and now, who would soon develop his hopeless crush on his very own Lucille Glass -- actually two of them--sequentially and many years separated, both of whom I met at yet another summer camp.  (One of the two even grew up in the Bronx, not all that far in distance from Mosholu Parkway where Lucille lived but light-years away demographically and culturally.)Like Herbie, I was that lad who would ride in the front car of the subway with his buddies, noses pressed up against the glass by the motorman's cab as we watched the train fly through the tunnel as we headed towards Ebbets Field in Brooklyn where we would emerge into dazzling sunlight at the Prospect Park station to watch the immortal Duke blast frozen ropes onto Bedford Avenue before the great No. 4 and the other Dodgers would desert us for the purported Sybaritic paradise of La-la Land.  The crushes would come a couple years later, and last forever.  I suspect Herbie, now 97, still has a thing for 96-year-old Lucille.Let's briefly summarize the plot:  1928. Herbie Bookbinder, a precocious and manipulative 11-year-old a year ahead of his class in school, develops a crush on a little girl, Lucille Glass, a grade behind him.  Lucille tells Herbie she's going to attend Camp Manitou, a kid's summer camp in the Berkshires run by Mr. Gauss, the school's principal.  Herbie wheedles his parents into letting him go there.  Also attending will be Lennie Krieger, a lunkheaded 13-year-old who's a year behind his class, and about to be left back again. Herbie's father and Lennie's father are co-owners of an ice-making business called \"The Place,, and there's an Irish silent partner named Powers who may or may not own a controlling interest in the business, and who wants to sell it to a third party so he can cover some bad outside investments.  Lucille's father is an attorney who represents the business, but seems to represent Powers more than the other two partners.Herbie gets to camp, and quickly learns it's no paradise; \"Uncle\" Gauss is far more interested in turning a profit by cutting corners than in molding childrens' characters.  Moreover, Herbie's a lousy athlete, and is taunted by the older boys, with the bullying led by Lennie.  Herbie, in an effort to impress Lucille, wants to build an amusement park-type ride for the camp's Mardi Gras Day, but the materials to build it will cost $50 (equivalent to $1,000 today) which he doesn't have.  How to get the money?  Steal it from his dad's safe (Herbie knows the combination); then leave a promissory note guaranteeing repayment.  In an mad series of adventures, Herbie and his cousin Cliff sneak out of camp, hitchhike the 100 miles back to the Bronx in the middle of the night, only to find Mr. Bookbinder and his partners engaged in an acrimonious discussion about selling off the company.  When the men are somehow distracted, Herbie and Cliff steal $50 from the thousands in the safe, hightail it out of there, and hitch back to Camp Manitou before reveille the next morning, without anyone noticing.  Herbie, assisted by Cliff, a broken-down horse, and the camp's handyman, who turns out to be Herbie's mentor, builds his ride. It's a big success, making far more than the $50 cost of materials, and most important, Herbie finally impresses the \"fickle\" Lucille.  But Herbie's troubles are only beginning, and the conclusion of the story brings the three legs of the plot together.One thing I really liked was that Herbie and his pals navigated the NYC subway system by themselves at age 11, just as I did back in the '50's.  NYC, including the subways, has become as safe as it was 55 years ago, but most parents think it's still 1990 and riding the subway is as dangerous as being in Afghanistan.  Today, if an 11-year-old is seen riding the subway, Child Protective Services will accuse his parents of neglect.  Another thing that I totally agreed with was that Wouk, without explicitly saying so, is opposed to smart kids skipping grades.  Herbie was 1 1/2 years ahead intellectually, but socially and physically he was still only 11, which is especially troublesome for boys.  Fortunately, the NYC school system has largely abandoned this.In conclusion, I found the story far more entertaining as an adult than I did as a child, and I loved it back then.  Yet I can't give it 5 stars, as much as I'd like to, because Wouk is overly on-the-nose in drumming the story's moral - the ends don't justify the means - into the innocent and not-so-innocent readers.  In the Caine Mutiny, where there are more than 50 shades of grey to describe the characters of the ensemble cast (including Lt. Commander Queeq), Wouk lets their actions do the moralizing, rather than editorialize. That said, I whole-heartedly recommend this for children of all ages, and would grade this 4 1/2 stars if I could.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I Read Two Different Books; Once at Age 12, the Second More than 50 Years Later", "unixReviewTime": 1393977600, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2014"}

The story is about a family in a small southern town called Heaven, Louisiana.The heroine is Schyler Crandall who has returned home to Heaven from London, where she escaped to after her sister, Tricia betrays her.  Schyler has come back to the family home named Belle Terre, an old southern home that she loves, because her father has had a major heart attack.  Since her father is in the hospital, Schyler takes on the family business.The book is heavy on very crass language and sex scenes.  If you are looking for a romance novel, then this book is hot what I would call romantic, The romantic involvement for Schyler is a Cajun who lives on the bayou, Cash Boudreaux.  He is as foul mouthed and crude as they come.  How any woman could find anything romantic about this man is beyound me.There are a number of other sex scenes with other characters that I basically skipped over.  I am not a blushing virgin and I have read many romance novels in the past but this one is so crass that I was even appalled.Also for dog lovers, this book has a pit bull fight that I could not read.  Cruelty to animals and to people is another reason that I did not like this book.  Also stereotypes abound about the south in this book that are so overdone as to be silly.&#34;Slow Heat in Heaven&#34; is one of Sandra Brown's earlier novels; I will stick to reading her more current books because they have more appeal to me.

It is filled with drama, heartbreak, and love. Oh yeah it also has plenty of crazy, funny moments by the Parker sisters.Cambree is off at college and has agreed to meet up with Max but other things take place which leads to Cambree being attacked. Cambree knows who is responsible for the attack on her, the pycho who has been torturing the Parker family for years, Brent. Even though Cambree is strong, this attack has pushed her to the one man that broke her heart, Max Baird. Her love for him never changed, but she just couldn't deal with all secrets and lies Max fed her. Cambree will not give in to easily to Max, he must prove himself.Max feels guilty about Cambree's attack, he was supposed to be protecting her, but in turn brought her into harms way. Max knows he screwed up in the past, and is determined to make it up to Cambree. He wants to start their relationship right this time with no lies and no secrets. Until everything can be revealed he has to hold back expressing the way he truly feels about Cambree, but is still going to be by her side no matter what. He will protect her this time, no more slip ups.As Max and Mitch work on a case against Brent, more secrets are revealed that may help them catching Brent and putting him away for good. Mitch has his own secret that he needs to tell the family but isn't for sure how or when he should tell them. Max and Mitch have to make tough decisions about what to tell the Parker family, because just they know any deviation in their plans could risk everything they have built up in the case so far.Even though there is so much drama going on with the Parker gang, they all no how to act crazy and have fun when the moment is right. The women in the family are strong-willed and sassy, while their men support them and know when to back down. I seriously love the things that come out the Parker sister's mouths, it is hilarious.

In 'Hard Choices' she tells us that she then planned to return to the Senate and was surprised when Obama offered the Secretary of State position to her. Supposedly she liked the idea of following one of her heroes, William Seward - another N.Y. senator who lost out to the ultimate president (Lincoln), and then served in his cabinet. (Who ever heard of William Seward? And why the focus on 'political heroes' instead of the opportunity to better America?) We're supposed to believe that personal political calculation had nothing to do with her acceptance - 'When your President asks you to serve, you should say Yes.'Hillary's narration shows her as consistently hawkish, consistent with her previously insisting on serving on the Armed Services Committee while a senator, and voting for the Iraq War. But I also saw her as constantly sticking her nose into every other nation's affairs - to the point she came across as domineering and insulting; not surprisingly, she doesn't see it that way in 'Hard Choices.'As for Benghazi, it's lot of double-talk, taking all positions at the same time, but failing to address the question of 'Why did the U.S. even have a State Dept. office in a non-capital city in Libya?' Putin - he's a bad guy, but she fails to see that his help is essential in addressing problems in Syria and Iran, issues with Russian hackers interfering with U.S. commerce and Internet traffic, and probably Iraq. Thus, her/our demonizing him (and others) simply makes progress in other areas more difficult, if not impossible. Pivoting to Asia - another demonizing tactic that supposedly makes America (and Hillary) look tough, but makes little sense. Today we're seeking help from Iran to stem the Sunni uprising in Iraq. We need China's ongoing help (and that of others) to address Global Warming; on the other hand, we also need to stop letting Asia in general (and China in particular) decimate our economy. Free Trade is working - for them, not us. Regardless, who in America wants to risk losing eg. L.A. and Seattle to defend some miniscule island in the Pacific, thousands of miles away?We also get the cloy ploy for sympathy - 'there's a double standard applied to women in politics.' Tell that to Angela Merkel and others.Overall, 'Hard Choices' is rather boring and overly vague on specifics. Meanwhile, her political spin continues - this week it's a lame explanation of why she charges so much for speaking engagements.If anybody out there doesn't think 'Hard Choices' isn't a planned step on the road to the 2016 nomination, I've got a lot of bridges I'd like to sell you.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "It's Really Hard To Take What This Woman Writes at Face Value", "unixReviewTime": 1402617600, "reviewTime": "06 13, 2014"}

When one of the two suspects is quickly found murdered, the Leggetts' story about what really happened begins to unravel. As it does, the past and the present slowly reveal themselves in a quagmire of trouble.For most novels, this would be enough material to fill one book, but for Dashiell Hammett, this is only the first of three parts that become steadily darker and seedier as the story progresses. The key figure in the book is Gabrielle Leggett, the confused, aloof daughter plagued by her own demons. Just when the Continental Op thinks he's done with the family, he's asked to watch over Gabrielle who's recovering from tragedy at a Temple, which appears to be a religious cult. From there, things only get worse.What can I say about Dashiell Hammett that hasn't already been said? Having read his work after so many years, I understand why he's considered one of the masters of the detective novel. It was a welcome change to read mystery that's kicking it old style. There's no hi-tech gimmicks in this story, just a lot of leg work and--on the downside--some sexism and racist slurs that were prevalent back then. Still, this whodunit will keep you guessing as hidden agendas and connections make a simple plot increasingly complex.

I loved all the twists and turns it took.  While the romance was as good as I've come to expect from this series, I have to say that I found the advancements in the overall story arc for the series equally compelling.Jessica and Travis were a great couple.  They had me laughing, sighing at the tender moments and groaning over their mutual stubbornness.  Before I go much further, I should point out that this one is very much connected to the ones that came before it.  It assumes the reader is familiar with the history of several people and the ongoing situation that makes them time travelers.Jessica Battaglia is a nurse at a hospital in Harrisburg and her life leaves her content with the exception of painful situation of her grandfather walking away from his marriage and taking up with a much younger woman.  She can't forgive him for this and doesn't trust his new wife, but she agrees to come to dinner along with her best friend, Hailey for moral support.  At the dinner, all goes wrong and she ends up accused of murdering her own grandfather and taken into custody even while her friend is taken to the hospital because Eve drugged them.  While sitting in the interrogation room, something weird happens and she blacks out only to end up in the countryside almost a hundred and fifty years before her time trying to convince a guy that she's not crazy.Travis Wade, a Union deserter and thought dead, is making his way back to his uncle in Harrisburg to get his help when he stumbles on a crazy beautiful woman who thinks she's from the future.  It's not long before he learns that her bizarre story is indeed the truth when he encounters more time travelers just like her and they all know his uncle and his brother.  His life is turned upside down and his attraction to Jessica is at the center of this.  Each time he is near her though he ends up saying or doing the wrong stuff that causes an argument.  He has no idea what to do and recognizes that if he doesn't figure it out quick, she'll leave him behind to return to her own time.Jessica is all stirred up when it comes to Travis and she doesn't know what to think about the irritating man who both makes her go weak at the knees and gives her the urge to hit him all at the same time.  She has the added distraction of worrying what is going on with her grandfather's murder and her friend's precarious survival in her absence.  Her heart is divided and she has no idea what to do.In the meantime, she is enjoying the camaraderie and family of people who have taken her into their life and made her one of their own.  Sophie and Jamie kindly do all they can for her and Travis, Em and Hannah are busy with babies and pregnancies and they're all caught up in the events brought on by the War.  The mysterious Madame and others are at work in the shadows orchestrating things that effect everyone's lives.As I said earlier, the plot on this one was loaded with action and suspense which I loved.  The pace moved along pretty good.  I enjoyed the reveals about the bad guys' plottings.  Jessica and Travis were key figures that the good guys had to protect and the bad guys take out for the opposing people to get their victories.  The murder plot in the contemporary time just made things even more exciting.As to the romance and characters of Jessica and Travis, I really liked it for the most part.  They were both so stubborn and unwilling to see the other's perspective at times that I got frustrated.  And there was a period where denial of feelings caused stupid setbacks for them, but fortunately they had Sophie and Jamie around to knock some sense into their heads.  I suppose all the conflict leading up to the resolve just made the resolve that much sweeter.It was fun to get a peek in with everyone else as they all played a big part in the story including Crow and Shaye in the future.  Looking forward to what comes next.This book and the series it is part of would appeal to those who enjoy sweeter romances in a time-travel situation that is spent mostly in the American Civil War era.My thanks to the author for gifting me a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review thoughts.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Rivals My Favorites in the Series For Romance and Suspense", "unixReviewTime": 1390089600, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2014"}

Based on the plot and writing of this one, I would be willing to check out the first book from the library. I can't say I was head over heels in love to want to buy it.Jaycee missed the last text of her best friend Rachel's life, caught up in her first kiss and lingering anger from a fight between the girls six months previously. This haunts her as she starts to believe there was more to Rachel's death than is being shared and confirmed when she receives unlikely aid from a friend of Rachel's, sending her down a path of gangs, hazing initiations, jealousy, and racial tensions in a small insular Washington town.For me, this book's big strength was its fast-paced. I read it all in one frantic day, barely able to put it down as each chapter only impelled me to read further. I credit this to the writing and plotting of Wolf-she really kept me on the edge of my seat.Also of interest was peeling back the layers of racism and mistrust between the old timers of the small town and the migrant workers, some of whom may be there illegally. When Rachel is murdered, it is all too easy to lay the blame at the feet of someone who allegedly has ties to a gang or whose skin is a different color from yours. I'm not sure this was handled as thoroughly as it could have been but it might be enlightening for some people and it helped to ratchet up the tension in the beginning of the book.But its weakness for me was its timid and naive narrator, though as the book progresses the reader gets a sense of her strong moral fortitude. I guess you could compare her to Fanny Price of Mansfield Park. She lives within her father's stringent rules and doesn't try to push the bounds of what it means to be a good girl, accepting her fate as one of the uncool. But her best friend considers her the best person she knows, someone who knows right from wrong and will diligently work to expose the truth and render justice (not vengeance, a key distinction). Saying that, even as I admire those kinds of people, they don't tend to be my favorite book characters. I like a bit more flamboyance and wit a la Elizabeth Bennet. The naivety is especially frustrating when it came to the culprit; I started having my suspicions probably later than others but it was eons before Jaycee with her trusting heart.Overall: I am eager to hear the opinion of people who have read Wolf's previous outing as well as those who are well-versed in YA mystery/thrillers. How do you think this stacks up? Personally I think this is a can-miss.

With no profanity or sexual scenes, this Christian-based story includes violence due to the topic of nuclear destruction.In this tome, United States First Lieutenant Michael Neill grew up with his missionary parents in the Ukraine but has not returned to the country for over eight years. As a Marine, he speaks several languages working as a Marine in the Security Forces Squadron.When his military friend&#8217;s plane flies too low near the Russian coastline due to inclement weather and is shot down by a fighter plane with stealth technology, Neill is heart-broken of his friend&#8217;s demise but knows God is in control. Yet on the broad scale, other governments want their own control and power in the former Soviet Union area, especially when it involves nuclear weapons.Ordered by the Unites States, the Marine&#8217;s instructions are to verify the status of thirty-six C-type nuclear warheads that are to be disassembled at the Odessa plant in the Ukraine. Added to his duties, he must uncover information about the sixth-generation stealth fighter that killed his comrade.While Neill meets up with his old Ukrainian friend, Andrei Ulyanov, who now runs the disarmament program at Odessa, the two Christian men pray for wisdom and guidance when they learn one warhead is missing. Realizing it could be a dirty bomb or full-fledge nuke, they, along with a persistent beautiful journalist, try to anticipate where two Russians who want to restore the old Soviet Union have hidden the deadly device.Counting down to detonation, readers become engaged in the military espionage and patriotism for one&#8217;s homeland as pages turn quickly to find out if this time there will be radiological dispersion. As a well-written, technical military tale, Wilson set up a great series where one man&#8217;s faith in God is consistent as he deals with others on a personal or global level.Thanks to CWA Review Crew for furnishing this book in exchange for a review of the reader&#8217;s honest opinion.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Having Faith During Ukrainian Nuke Crisis", "unixReviewTime": 1389398400, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2014"}

He certainly knows how to make your spine tingle.  He stands with the most popular authors of this genre as he writes another gripping suspense.  Sacred rituals await a teenaged girl as the villain scopes her out at the mall watching her dance around her boyfriend.  That evening George Madden drops off his wife, Edna, at the weekly prayer meeting.  As usual, he has his own weekly meeting at the prostitute club, \"Silk Stockings.\"  After he gets his satisfaction, it's hard for him to see while driving on the dark country road at night.  However, as he glances toward a stand of trees, he notices a person dressed in all white running and stumbling through the trees.  He stops, grabs a flashlight, and works his way through the brambles to find a young girl, barely breathing, laying on the ground.  He hoists her over his shoulder to his car and takes her to the hospital. He feels he's likely to be in deep do-do when he has to explain this to his wife Edna. Doctor Sydia Garrison who specializes in surgery at Medical University of South Carolina is sickened by the barbaric assault on this young teenager.  A local news reporter, Janice Porter, gets a tip from a fellow who works at the hospital, so she quickly attempts to be the lead reporter and goes to the hospital.  There she sees the infamous Detective Dan Hammer who has a strong dislike for reporters, which only hampers her a bit to get a report to her boss. Very soon, as the police search the area where George found the mutilated girl, another young girl's body is found.  This leads to FBI Agent Harry Wright into the fast moving investigation of the serial killer tagged, \"The Mutilator.\"  This is very compelling story, with the characters well defined, in fast reading style of writing by the author.

Fans of both the dystopian and New Adult romance genres will definitely want to read this exceptional story!Opening Sentence: The dream was changing.The Review:Ember and Chase have gone through hell to be together. The Moral Militia. The Rehabilitation Center. Secrets and betrayals by people they once considered friends. The number of people they&#8217;ve watched die. Yet nothing has come as close to truly separating them as the emotional scars they both carry after shooting a young guard in Chicago while rescuing Rebecca.After all, it&#8217;s not like they can take a time out to talk about Chase&#8217;s darkest secrets or Ember&#8217;s greatest fear. With the only safe house they knew of destroyed, their small group of survivors from the MM attack is scrambling to find a place to recover. Ember, Chase, Rebecca, Sean and four others have set out from a temporary shelter to find supplies and a better hiding spot for those injured during the tunnel collapse. No one is happy about leaving the weakest, virtually defenseless members of their group behind and they all feel the pressure to return by the promised deadline only a few days away.  Ember, Chase and the rest have barely had time to sleep, let alone hold any private soul-bearing conversations and their hope is fading fast. The only thing keeping any of them going is the hope that Tucker and the two carriers who went with him can find a rebellion post in the Red Zone.The news from Tucker isn&#8217;t good when he finally makes contact with Ember though. The first rebellion post is deserted. The news that one of the carriers, the name given to members of the rebellion who deliver messages between posts, is missing is even worse. Tucker is clearly worried about the situation, however most of his concern seems to be focused on Ember &#8211; something which makes things with Chase even tenser. Despite their issues, it&#8217;s clear Ember loves Chase and vice versa. Still, she can&#8217;t deny her feelings for the guy who both betrayed Chase and murdered her mother. She doesn&#8217;t want to be concerned about his safety or feel relief at hearing his voice&#8230;except she does. Tucker has proven himself several times over and Ember unwillingly feels a softening in her heart toward him.Rather than think too long about the odd Tucker situation, her strained friendship with Rebecca or even the worry she feels over Chase pulling away from her, Ember instead focuses on a trail of subtle clues possibly left by the rebel group known as Three. Ember is certain Three is the key to unifying the rebellion groups &#8211; the only hope they have to defeat the President and his Bureau of Reformation. The only problem? No one knows for sure if Three exists or how to get in contact with them. Ember is sure they are getting closer to the elusive group and is convinced they just need more time to find them. For as much guilt and concern Ember felt up to this point for leaving the injured people behind, she&#8217;s pretty quick to talk the others into following the trail of clues rather than returning by the promised deadline. I understand her reasoning &#8211; finding Three would benefit them much more than simply turning around &#8211; but this still seems like a harsh decision. It reflects how much she&#8217;s changed since Article 5, how all of them have become hardened to the world of Statutes and murder sentences for single mothers.This change is further emphasized when Ember&#8217;s group is ambushed. These may not be MM members yet she reminds herself that anyone attacking her is her enemy. At least it appears that way, until the other group&#8217;s leader is revealed to be a man from Chase&#8217;s past. A dangerous man who has the power to hurt Chase more than he already has. Afraid Chase will push her even further away if she reveals her true feelings regarding the guy; Ember instead stays silent on the sudden reappearance of the man she trusts less than Tucker. The only good news is the rest of the people with him are rebels who survived another safe house attack.The story, which was in no way slow up to this point, really starts to fly once Ember&#8217;s group meets up with these survivors. It&#8217;s hard to talk about the rest of the story without giving anything away though. What I can say is there are a lot of hard lessons learned when they eventually do find the mysterious Three. Secret agendas and more deaths &#8211; several of which left me a sobbing mess &#8211; keep the tension almost unbearably high for the rest of the book, making it very difficult to put it down for even a moment. There are double and triple crosses, but the killer is that there aren&#8217;t purely good or purely evil aspects for most characters or their actions. The will to survive can make people do things they never imagined they could to make it one more hour, one more day. There are plot twists I saw coming and others that completely surprised me.None of the relationships in Three are simple, but there were a number of sweet moments that warmed my heart. Ember and Chase&#8217;s relationship is definitely one of the more beautiful ones I&#8217;ve read in a while. They&#8217;ve both changed so much since the first book, yet their love has only deepened. The tenderness Simmons is able to portray between Ember and Chase, and to a greater extent Rebecca and Sean, is refreshing and unique in Young Adult and New Adult pieces where physical attraction is the primary focus. Finally, I&#8217;d be lying if I didn&#8217;t admit how heartbreaking the ending was for me. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any other way Simmons could&#8217;ve done her remarkable story justice though.Three may be the first book I&#8217;ve ever whole-heartedly and universally recommended for everyone with no thought as to what genre it should be placed in. Though there are sexual situations and violence in the trilogy, the overall story belongs among social commentary classics like Fahrenheit 451.Notable Scene:&#8220;Why are they here?&#8221; I asked, suddenly angry at them &#8212; the dead people. They shouldn&#8217;t have scared me. I&#8217;d seen worse. Much worse.&#8220;Let&#8217;s go get some air,&#8221; he said.I peeled his fingers away.&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t they clear out like everyone else?&#8221; There wasn&#8217;t any sign of violence; it was like they&#8217;d laid down to sleep and not woken up, and for some reason this bothered me even more.&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;&#8220;They should have evacuated.&#8221; The government had cleared this area years ago.I swiped at my arms again, feeling the tickle on my skin.&#8220;Maybe they didn&#8217;t want to.&#8221; He chewed his bottom lip, looking into the room.His words shifted my fear to something more solid, something stronger. I&#8217;d had it backward. These people hadn&#8217;t given up, they&#8217;d made their stand. Maybe that was all we really got: a choice to control our own fate.FTC Advisory: Tor Teen/Macmillan provided me with a copy of Three.

Karissa has no money and her only family is her mom.  Her mother is paranoid and Karissa believes she is somewhat mentally unstable.  She is also a recluse. Karissa meets our hero Naz when he is in her classroom speaking to one of her professors.  Shaking him down actually but Karissa does not know this. And that is how they meet. Naz isn't just some handsome stranger.  He is a very dangerous man. And he wants Karissa. This book ends in a cliffhanger that was so delicious!I devoured every word of this book.  I loved Naz so much and I was a little afraid of him too.  I especially loved how the author did not do the insta love connection.  Naz's possessiveness comes to a slow boil and you are just like the lobster...you don't know its to late until...well its to late.  Karissa is a bit immature and a bit trusting but it is believable for her age and situation.  I mean what young girl on her own wouldn't want to be around a dark and sexy man.  And he is dark.  And dangerous.  And sexy.  But the author does a great job of allowing the reader to learn these things along with Karissa.  We are not told what a bad ass he is.  We are not told how violent and deadly.  But we learn and we realize like someone in her shoes. Karissa had realistic and believable reactions to everything Naz did.  And Naz...oh man...you do not walk away from this man.  I am praying that the author keeps up his alpha domineering ways in the next book. I want the dark.

Judging by this book he is 90% scientist and only 10% spiritual seeker. The only reason he gives for rejecting the materialist world view is that it is depressing and renders life meaningless. That's a good reason to be a spiritual seeker, but does not provide evidence for a different world view.The author believes life is meaningless without a belief in life in after death, so he writes about paranormal phenomena, OBEs, NDEs, and so forth. The problem is that he presents no compelling evidence for these things. His scientific side requires him to hedge and examine evidence for spiritual phenomena from a skeptical viewpoint. The author treats telekinesis, clairvoyance, telepathy, remote viewing, OBEs, NDEs, and so forth. But after examining the &#34;evidence&#34; in light if the author's scientific &#34;weasel words,&#34; you are less likely to believe in these things than to accept them as real. Even the author's single so-called PSI experience is very weak and unconvincing.The author states that &#34;after death contacts&#34; would provide the most compelling evidence for an afterlife, and then writes a chapter that concludes not only that there is NO evidence for such, but it is just too hard to study &#34;scientifically.&#34; The theme runs throughout the book that science has led us astray, yet we have no choice but to use the scientific method to set us back on the right path. As a practicing scientist with a reputation to uphold, the author attempts to both criticize science and appease his colleagues at the same time. How can the author believe that science is at once the problem AND the solution?The author's message boils down to this: &#34;I want to believe in an afterlife, and in spite of the lack of evidence I WILL believe because the alternative is too depressing (meanwhile, I will look forward to the day when science gives me a good reason to believe)..", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not At All Compelling", "unixReviewTime": 1400889600, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2014"}

Cautions rightfully about Vendors who use the term \"big data\" on totally unrelated topics so can get your attention, ear and business.Chapter Two And Three: Goes over who will be impacted by Big data (Ex : If you move things, If you sell items, If Money is involved) and how .

After reading it, I don&#8217;t think the blurb does it justice. This book felt like it was written as an erotic suspense with lots of twists and turns. I was gripped by the story from the beginning and could not put it down. I think it should have been said that this is a student/teacher romance. BUT don&#8217;t allow preconceived notions to let that turn you off&#8230;. trust me, this isn&#8217;t what you&#8217;re thinking. This book wasn&#8217;t what I was expecting and I couldn&#8217;t be happier about it.In the beginning, we meet Addison (Addy) and it&#8217;s pretty clear she is in a mental institution. Her doctor &#8220;Doc&#8221; is trying to get her to talk and she seems to be in some kind of psychosis where she won&#8217;t speak. I was really excited that the book just throws you off the cliff and you have to try and figure out what is happening. From the beginning all you know is that something is wrong and you want to know how she got there. The most intriguing part of the beginning of the book is that Addy keeps thinking she&#8217;s alone and &#8220;he&#8221; is gone. The first three chapters of this book set an amazing tone of the story that follows. Addy was a dark and sexual character to get inside. I was captivated by her maturity even though she was young. I loved how she was so bold and not embarrassed by her body or her desires.Mr. McKendrick wasn&#8217;t at all what I was expecting. When someone says student/teacher romance I immediately think the guy is going to be a sleazy creep. I assume he is preying on an innocent girl or taking advantage of a vulnerability. I can honestly say those thoughts NEVER crossed my mind with him. I felt like from the beginning he was trying to thwart Addy&#8217;s advances. He was very clear that she was his student and it wasn&#8217;t going to happen. He kept his distance and told her &#8220;no&#8221; repeatedly. I loved that he wasn&#8217;t your typical guy looking for a young piece of a**. He was a man, who&#8217;s heart connected to Addy&#8217;s. I fell in love with Mr. McKendrick and I am not even the least bit ashamed. He does reveal his first name in the book, but it&#8217;s such an intimate scene I&#8217;ll let you find that out on your own.I am not even a little sorry at how much this book turned me on. I think I even said I was going to make my husband tell me &#8220;no&#8221; over and over again after I finished this book. I have never been so turned on in my life by a man trying to stop a woman&#8217;s sexual advances. The tease, the build up, and the sex are 5 of 5 stars. My vagina and I were totally in agreement that this book was a sexual beast.For me, this book was an A. The story was suspenseful and captivating and I couldn&#8217;t stop reading. I was wrapped in the mystery of what happened to Addy and why Mr. McKendrick was missing. I didn&#8217;t see how this book was going to play out from the beginning, so I loved that it kept me on edge. I read this book in a day and was angry at myself for finishing it so fast. I don&#8217;t know about the author&#8217;s other books, but this blew me away. If you are looking for book that has a lot of heat, and a bit of a thriller aspect to it, then this is it!

Stationed at Pearl Harbor, Morris Sullivan owes his survival to Robert Dobbins, a black seaman who died pulling his comrades from the water. Seeking closure, Morris is determined to thank Robert&#8217;s family for his sacrifice, but his effort to honor a fallen hero blooms into a romance that will define the man he becomes and challenge everything he believes.Spanning the better part of five decades, A Life Apart, is a tedious historical, but under that it is a heartbreakingly beautiful novel of prejudice, strength, forgiveness and love that defies convention. I personally found Marlow&#8217;s peppering of the story with tenuously relevant headlines from the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s distracting, but the depth and earnestness of the love triangle she created between Morris, Beatrice and Agnes provided a powerfully moving thesis that struck me to the core.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Life Apart: A Novel", "unixReviewTime": 1399075200, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2014"}

The further I read the more interesting and natural the story became. I loved the brothers and roommates in their own ways but I had a particular fondness for George and the prank wars between him and Kyle. Dean seemed like he was just trying to look out for Kyle but in doing so he didn't leave a lot of room for her to make her own decisions and I think it was actually doing more harm than good.I still have questions about the night that Kyle regrets the most in her life it just seemed liked we didn't get a lot of details of the aftermath or in fact the aftermath wasn't as serious as it seemed to be to affect Kyle in such a strong way. I was also a little confused about her family's reaction to Nick. One minute it seemed like they wanted her to stay away from him and the next it was like they just wanted her to move on from her previous relationship and get a boyfriends already.I loved Kyle but frankly he's still sort of a mystery to me. He's totally swoonworthy, I mean really a British accent, yes please. He is also patient and kind but persistent in his efforts to make Kyle understand how much he cares about her.Now can we talk about the last chapter and the ending? I have so many questions about Nick's sudden 360, what happened, what's going on? Then the way the book ended, say what? I was not expecting that at all and now I'm biting my nails to find out what happens next.Over all I think this was a great debut and I could see the growth of the author from the beginning to the end of the book.

{"reviewerID": "A2LM1HE1HAXMVB", "asin": "0393239357", "reviewerName": "A. Menon", "helpful": [3, 5], "reviewText": "Much about the world always stays the same but in the background there are often big trends that are hard to see when in the thick of it.  In the Second Machine Age, authors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee try to distinguish the forrest from the trees and discuss whats happening in the new digital age and how it is affecting us all economically.  This book discusses business trends and what is happening in information technology and analyzes it from the viewpoint of economics.  It gives perspective on the labour market, the rise of inequality, the needs of the new economy and the policies we should consider in this new environment.  It is always sensible and does its best to discuss issues evenly.  Despite us all living in this new technological age it is difficult to take a step back and try to get a true appreciation of whats going on is challenging.  This book aids in that process and helps frame the issues for the reader to think about.The authors start by considering human progress through our history.  They show how population growth as well as our social developement (as considered by Ian Morris in &#34;Why the West Rules for Now&#34;) has grown exponentially from the first industrial revolution and they discuss the technology and process that got us here.  The authors then discuss their experiences in the present and the journey they took in one of google's automated vehicles.  The author's argue that such applications of technology were not possible in the recent past but the exponential growth of computational power has enabled us to start doing things that seemed impossible just a few years ago.  They discuss the amazing progress in robotics and AI in the last few years and how this progress is just the beginning.  They give some metrics about how much information is getting digitized and how with the price of memory and processing going to 0 how much we have increased in terms of cataloguing.  In particular statistics like 10% of all the photos ever taken were taken last year with more photos taken every 2 minutes than in the entire 19th century.  The digitization of our daily lives is hard to fathom but when put in such terms the magnitude is astounding.  The authors then discuss innovation.  Recently the limits of human progress has been a hot topic of debate.  Robert Gordon recently questioned whether growth was sustainable and has argued the current growth trends and productivity enhancing innovations pale in comparison to the technologies of upheaval in the past.  The authors argue against this perspective and discuss the idea that growth comes from recombining old good ideas into better new ideas and how given how many more people are being brought into the new economy with the barriers to entry being low in the digital economy meaning we are in a new digital age of progress and we are at the beginning still.  The authors discuss how GDP as a measure is insufficient and how there is enormous consumer surplus created from recent technologies.  They discuss how the economy has migrated from rival to non-rival meaning that in the new economy the things we often value the most have negligible marginal cost of production.  An example being Wikipedia might destroy GDP by removing the need for labour for encyclopaedia britannica but has created massive consumer surplus for people at large.  The authors discuss how the new economy creates enormous economies of scale and as a result the distribution of incomes will be fundamentally altered as gains are not attributed to relative productivity but go to the very top at the expense of the rest.  The repurcussions being that average and median incomes continue to diverge and there is little natural reversion in that process.  The authors discuss what they think are ways for people to adapt to the new economy.  They give basic examples of how right now, at the core, people using machines are the ones enabled we are not in a machines purely replace people world.  The authors are very even and do not conclude that supply side innovations naturally create demand for labour and how fast innovation can run the risk of constantly leaving a portion of the population behind the production frontier.  At the same time the authors discuss ways in which we can address some of the adverse consequences of the digitization of the economy through intelligent policy.The Second Machine Age is a must read for those thinking about how the world has been changing since the dawn of the internet.  It is hard to not be convinced by much of what the author's discuss and the book is full of insight the reader can easily take away after reading.  It gives food for thought about what skills we should always be thinking about adding as well as broad social policy we might need for the future that has been different from the past.

Sakavic has captured the language of youth making it all the more real. A word of caution. You do have to place close attention to the background character explanations to get various relationships. This enables you to follow certain sequences. Admittedly, the author could have a bit more clarity in this area. Eventually, though, you figure it out.The problem I have with a series is when you have to wait for the final installment. It's rather a let down. But, I did read the conclusive segment should occur sometime January, 2014. I can hope. I have one issue with the second book that did follow a conventional mind set that bugs me.  Nicky(Neil's teammate and openly gay character) rants to Neil about the only way Neil will have a happy life is having a significant other.  Otherwise, this dooms Neil to a joyless life. I've commented on this issue previously in other critiques. Are you telling me that even thought I have decent caring friends, a purposeful life, a loving relationship with myself open toward the other  that if I 'don't have someone' I'm doomed to a miserable life.? Listen up. There are people who lead a happy existence with caring attachments and are ok. Don't get me wrong. It is desirable to have a partner but not a need to prevent a fulfilling life.

Two young people, damaged by their pasts find a friendship that relieves their feelings of isolation. As Robin and Phoenix find true acceptance with each other their feelings grow and they find love, even though neither believes they are deserving of it. Robin, a college student who became the campus party girl made a drunken mistake one night that will change her life and possibly destroy her best friend. As it haunts her every day, she isolates herself from those around her and vows never to drink again. Enter Phoenix, just released from prison, alone, with nothing but the borrowed clothes on his back, and a couch to sleep on at his cousins&#8217; house. Phoenix seems to be in control of himself at all times, until any type of spark ignites the rage he keeps bottled up inside. Will these two find the support they need from each other or will they need to face their demons alone?Filled with angst, anger, guilt, and the tenuous threads of love, Believe is the story of two individuals who must learn to love themselves and accept that their own shortcomings are their greatest enemies while accepting that they are worthy of love that is given freely.Erin McCarthy has done a wonderful job creating characters that feel real and could be someone one could find on any campus when first cut loose into the world. Using the POVs of both main characters further illustrates her ability to give life to her tale. The fact that I wanted to shake them both one minute and hug them the next, means I was in the moment from start to finish. Her world is like a tour of campus life, the friendships and bonds, the turmoil of being a young person out on their own in a world they were not expecting.

As a matter of fact, what she discovers about her family makes her literally ill with horror and fear.  For she mourns her father who loved her dearly but she also mourns the man as tyrant and killer who has tortured and killed thousands; at least he is responsible for these acts even if he has not literally carried them out himself in a single-handed way.  The word her friends use about the children&#8217;s fairy tales and practices of her father&#8217;s rule is &#8220;barbaric,&#8221; a painful word that sears through her mind and feelings for days and weeks.  How does one cope with her father&#8217;s guilt, that which took the lives of families and friends of people she actually knows in America?Now Laila is in America.  Several people are interested in her, the man who is attempting to convince her mother to cooperate with CIA interests, the man who doesn&#8217;t trust Laila initially but eventually will come to accept her at face value, and a normal American boy who wants to write a journalistic account of her father&#8217;s life and her experiences in the nameless country from which she is in exile.  Its these relationships that evolve in dramatic ways that cause her to grow up fast.  Whether the reader thinks this evolution is healthy and good for Laila is left up to his or her imagination!We learn that her Uncle is now ruling the land Laila once called &#8220;home.&#8221;  He spends his time frantically calling Lails&#8217;s mother.  Over time, Laila experiments with her new life in the United States, dressing like other girls do, dancing, and cultivating friendships that are &#8220;normal&#8221; for Americans but very, very different from what she knew before.  Meanwhile, she learns the truth about her family&#8217;s place of &#8220;royalty,&#8221; and that changes her forever.  Her choices after that will affect her family and her former country forever!The author tells us, after the story ends, the seeds that planted this unforgettable story in her head and what she wished the reader to experience throughout the account and afterward.  J. C. Carleson brilliantly succeeds in her quest and the reader may reach his or her own decision regarding same.

Um, yes please!Audrey is a wallflower, but wants so much more from her life than what her parents have planned for her. She longs for adventure and an escape. She certainly dives head first into adventure when Ethan Jagger/Locke shows up injured at her window. I liked Audrey, she has guts and I admired her determination to enjoy her life and escape the box her parents were trying to put her in. But I found her actions rather puzzling in the first third of the book. I'm not sure how much she knew Ethan previously, but her grandfather was just assaulted by some ruffians and she up and leaves with a man she barely knows who is clearly running from someone. Then when she realises that Ethan is running from Bow Street, she continues on her 'adventure' with him. It just came across as kind of reckless and foolish, to be honest. Fair enough, I understood her motivations, but I read it with a raised eyebrow. Once Ethan and Audrey's relationship develops, the eyebrow lowered and it made sense that she stuck by him and defended him.Ethan has a criminal past that he's trying to put behind him. He wants nothing more than to let go of the past and mend his relationship with his brother, unfortunately that past does not want to let go of him. When he's falsely accused of murdering a Marquess, he's forced to literally run for his life. Ethan likes Audrey, but he never intended to bring her with him. As they spend more time together though,he realises that she's an unusual young lady and there's a lot more to her than meets the eye. Ethan has done a lot in his past that he regrets and he wants to become a better man, the man his father intended for him to be.I enjoyed Ethan and Audrey's relationship. I thought her optimism and innocence balanced his cynicism and made him a bit less jaded. Ethan is a good man at heart, and Audrey sees that man.I could get a little lost with all the characters, at times. It's part of a series and can be read as a stand alone, but there are a lot of characters who are clearly in the previous books in the series and it could be difficult to remember who was who. Although, it doesn't affect the reading of this book particularly.Overall, I liked it but I didn't love it. The characters held a lot of promise but fell a bit flat for me.

Lee Zimmerman \"Trekscribbler (aka Ed)\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Now that Dark Horse Comic&#8217;s tenure with the Star Wars license is starting to wind down, I wanted to take some time to go back and reread some of the bigger, bolder titles that have seen release throughout the years.  Like many longtime readers, I&#8217;m immeasurably bummed about the move of the comics from the Horse to the Mouse House of Marvel (I&#8217;m really not looking forward to the Vader/Wolvie crossover); and &#8211; in order to keep it real &#8211; I&#8217;m revisiting some of the yarns that made waves.One of the first big breakthroughs was something called DARK EMPIRE.  It went on to have a few sequels, but &#8211; for my tastes &#8211; I honestly didn&#8217;t much care for this tale even when it first hit the shelves.  It isn&#8217;t that I disliked the idea of exploring an Emperor Palpatine resurrected in the days of the New Republic fumbling to establish a firm footing; it&#8217;s just that so much of Tom Veitch&#8217;s story felt like character retreads.More after the break &#8230;(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Essentially, the story that unfolds here is that the Empire isn&#8217;t quite as dead as our heroes &#8211; Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa-Solo, Han Solo, and more &#8211; long believed it to be.  In fact, some lingering elements in the inner galaxies have gone a long way toward re-establishing their own union, putting the New Republic back on its heels and having to fight in smaller isolated conflicts once more.  Naturally, this brings our gang back together, and they&#8217;re rushed to the front lines in order to give yet one more &#8216;New Hope&#8217; street cred with faltering worlds.Lo and behold, our young Skywalker &#8211; now a bit older &#8211; discovers that the Emperor (aka Darth Sidious) has been resurrected (in a sense).  It would seem that his life essence has become a part of the living Dark Side &#8211; much like Obi-wan Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker have merged with the Light Side elements; all the former Palpatine need do is pull a younger version of himself out of a clone canister and &#8211; viola &#8211; new Emperor!  Now, he&#8217;s using some massive new weapons known as &#8216;World Devastators&#8217; to crush planets that won&#8217;t bend to his will.Just as was the thematic undercurrent for the Luke Skywalker character in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI (and many, many Extended Universe tales since then), this new Emperor wants to turn our hero to the Dark Side.  What makes this tale a bit different is that the Jedi seemingly does embrace it, though he admits to readers over and over again that he&#8217;s done so only to get closer to Palpatine so that he can inevitably defeat him.  Leia, Han, and the others don&#8217;t see as clearly what Luke&#8217;s motivations are, so they spend the bulk of their time trying to contact the Jedi Master so they can &#8216;reclaim&#8217; him for their side &#8230; and, so far as I can tell, that about wraps it up.DARK EMPIRE is a worthy read, but it&#8217;s nothing that really smacks of originality or epicness (if you&#8217;ll pardon my creation of the word).  The Emperor is the same &#8211; as are all of our regular players &#8211; so nothing new added to the mix pretty much leaves this tale tasting like something we&#8217;ve all had before.  That in itself isn&#8217;t enough reason to resist the story&#8217;s obvious temptations &#8211; could it be that Luke won&#8217;t survive the Emperor&#8217;s machinations this time? &#8211; which is why I basically deem it worth a read but little else.  Plus, DARK EMPIRE has a weird artistic template; it&#8217;s almost as if illustrator Cam Kennedy (who does terrific work) made some curious decision to color the worlds of George Lucas monochromatically, and, for the life of me, I can&#8217;t figure out how anyone thought that was a good idea.  (???)  One of the most enduring qualities of STAR WARS is how different the various worlds and machines and droids look from one to another, so casting so very many panels in as few color choices as possible makes no narrative much less commercial sense.Heck, even the long-rumored dead Boba Fett shows up for what plays out like an almost obligator appearance, one meant to recapture the magic of the bounty hunters glory days instead of adding legitimacy to the web being spun here.  I like Boba Fett.  I get most fanboys like Boba Fett.  But his appearance here?  It just didn&#8217;t need to be.RECOMMENDED.  I&#8217;m smitten with most of the Dark Horse&#8217;s adventures from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away; still, there&#8217;s something about DARK EMPIRE that just underwhelmed me.  There were a few moments of greatness &#8211; Luke&#8217;s commitment to kinda/sorta bringing the Force into balance; Leia&#8217;s love for family despite the obvious hardships; Han&#8217;s ribbing of his brother-in-law; etc. &#8211; but most of them underscore relationships already so firmly established that there was little new brought to the game.  Otherwise, much of this tale flew on autopilot, and it was hardly as DARK as it could&#8217;ve been.  Good &#8211; worth a read &#8211; but far from great.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Blast from the Past: DARK EMPIRE Reconsidered After All These Years", "unixReviewTime": 1404086400, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2014"}

Through his usual narrative, there comes some clarity which has left Civil War novices confused about the Vicksburg Campaign and the novel stands as a great introduction for those people interested in something besides the War in the East.  The second part of his series is a welcome addition not only to the bookshelves of Civil War buffs, but the literary world as well.Jeff Shaara is a New York Times bestseller and began his career with the work preceding his father&#8217;s called Gods and Generals and finished the story with The Last Full Measure.  Shaara has won numerous accolades for his works on the revolution called Rise to Rebellion and The Glorious Cause.  After his series on the Civil War in the West, he will be pursuing the Texas conflict and the Korean War.For the first time in his career, Jeff Shaara has given us the outlook of a woman.  She does not have just one chapter, but many telling the story of the civilians who had to hide out in the caves and sometimes gave their services as nurses.  The narrative of the hospitals is gruesome and not for the faint of heart, but even more so, the narrative of life in the caves is even worse.  There are some points in literature which stick with you for the rest of your life and his description of life in the caves and the starvation of the men and women of the city of Vicksburg is one of those passages.  Whether it be the slaughter of the horses so they could eat all the way down to killing dogs for food, the disturbing image comes when there is no reservation about eating these animals.  Even the conditions of the high command of the Confederate army is deplorable.  In this volume, Shaara chooses to use Pemberton as the voice of the Confederate command structure instead of Johnston and rightfully so.  Pemberton was more the defender of Vicksburg than any other commander.  He does, however, give Pemberton the same treatment his father gave Longstreet in The Killer Angels.  He has taken a character which was not always in good light and given him a favorable view.  In the end, you feel sorry for Pemberton and wonder what he could have done to further his fight.  But knowing there was nothing for him to do was quite sad and some say could change the opinions of people about the man.  On the Union side,  we have the regulars from the last book, A Blaze of Glory, with Private Bauer from the 17th Wisconsin and General Sherman.  Something, however, can be said about reading a book with the opposition has the upper hand constantly in the campaign.  While there are small battles throughout the siege which the Union army loses, there is something in the back of the reader&#8217;s mind saying that they still have the upper hand in the situation which makes this book a bit more history than novel.  Which brings me to the major point of my review.  A Chain of Thunder is a good book, but is more nonfiction novel than an actual historical fiction book.  I learned more about the Vicksburg Campaign in this book than I have learned from any of his other works and once again, Shaara shines when he only has to worry about a single campaign or battle instead of stretching the work over a few years.I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of historical fiction because while being such, it is quite different from what the standard is for those types of works.  The detail in which is gives to the campaign of Vicksburg is quite good and while he makes the reader feel sympathy for the Confederate army, there is still an even divide between the Union and Confederate accounts.  Jeff Shaara&#8217;s War in the West series is a very welcome addition to my own Civil War library and should be a welcome addition to any other history fan as well.Matthew Bartlett - Author, Gettysburg Chronicle", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "General Pemberton Finally Gets His Due Diligence", "unixReviewTime": 1403481600, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2014"}

I myself am a huge fan of this series so i was glad to get this extra little bit with two awesome characters. Ford ( as he is called in sector 4) gets hurts in a terrible motorcycle accident and is stuck behind his desk while he heals up the slow and painful old fashion way. He finds himself with a new assistant assigned to him, Mia. Mia is new to sector 4 and is not a part of the gang but was saved from her snake in the grass Patron from sector 2. Now she is hoping to learn how to be a individual and change everything she's ever been taught and maybe fit in somewhere. Although Ford is gruff and a bit on the mean side at first he slowly let's Mia in. Another amazing story from Kit Rocha. The characters are always so real and filled with rich layers. I don't know how they can keep track of everyone and make each character stand out still. Somehow she makes her characters vulnerable and strong at the same time and it's a great combination the way that it is done. If you have not read this series you should definitely give it a try.

I'd always suggest reading a series in order obviously but Ms Spear has done an excellent job here of telling a darn good story with an intriguing plot and filled with characters that are impossible not to like.David is an agent working for Jag and it's his mission to keep an eye on a pair of wayward teenage boys who seem to have a knack for getting into mischief. He overhears some conversation that leads him to believe they are somehow involved in the abduction of a jaguar from a zoo so needs to coordinate with the Enforcer who  is on the case. The Enforcer is a very desirable Jaguar female called Tammy and right from the first meeting it's clear she's more than a handful! This fiercely determined woman likes to feel that the job always comes first but it's hard to deny the charm that David exudes. Sent together to Belize to track down the twins David and Tammy uncover the truth about the abduction and along the way find something more precious , love!I loved Tammy as she was certainly an independent woman who focussed so much on being the best that she could be but she has serious trust issues. Tammy is not looking for a man and she's certainly not looking for a mate but the irrepressible David is a force to be reckoned with ! What can I say about David? He's just such a warm character with so much fun hard wired into his nature. A genuinely loveable rogue that teases the heroine mercilessly but stands strong when it's called for.I found this book to be a really easy quick read and indeed I stayed up late until I had finished it as I liked the characters so much. Although a paranormal romance theres a lot of suspense and action here with a mystery to solve and I really enjoyed the journey that the author takes us on. Setting the bulk of this book in the jungles of Belize helped to add atmosphere and this author certainly excels at world building . The basic mission is a hunt and trust me when I say the twin boys that David's tracking are set to lead David and Tammy on a very wild ride ! These two boys are far more intelligent then David expected but harnessing their enthusiasm is a job in itself and I'd really like to read more about them both.This book sizzles with sexy leads that will leave you breathless.

She is struggling to pay her rent in her cramped studio apartment that she couldn&#8217;t afford. Food to her was a luxury and her only friend was a boy named Justin; who liked her for more than just a friend. She received an email from the elite China White Supper Club that would change everything for her. She was to play for the patrons while they ate dinner and it was one of the most coveted invitation for aspiring pianist like her to receive. During this night she met two very important people that would change the course of her future. The first was the owner of the club; Abraham Constantine. The second was Calisto Tremaine; a beautiful young woman who portrayed all that wealth and privilege had to offer.  Calisto offered Aria $10,000 to play one night for a celebration for the secret organization called The Midnight Society. Aria couldn&#8217;t believe her luck but something told her this would change her life for good; she agreed to the performance and the story that Calisto weaved for her about her being the &#8220;Golden Virgin, a mysterious pianist who lives a life of chastity so that your music is as pure as your heart.&#8221; She goes to this celebration where everyone including her is required to wear a mask. She meets the man who will own her heart, body and soul; Shadow Tremaine as he pulls her into his world. A world filled with luxury, seduction, hot sex and violence. Once pulled into this world Aria has to make a decision that will alter her forever. This book rendered me speechless at times and at other times he made me so emotional.

His idea was to send families to a remote area of Alaska to colonies and grow the Matanuska Valley. The really superb thing about this book is these two authors use real and fictional characters to develop their narrative.Dr Jeremiah Vaughan's life is destroyed by allegations of abuse. When he uses a ground-breaking IV sedation technique with an influential patient, and the patient dies, the authorities are out for blood. This causes his license to be stripped away. Because of this, his intended and her mother want nothing to do with the shame. A has-been doctor is not what a high society woman wants on her arm. Fleeing from the hurt and rejection, from not only his fiance but also his own parents Jeremiah jumps at the chance to work alongside his mentor in a remote Alaskan village, far away from danger and pain...or so he thought.Gwyn is struggling with fear, rejection, and trust as she tends to her beloved village as a nurse. Her father (who is also the town's only doctor) is ecstatic at the prospect of seeing his village grow with the new colonization. As they race to ready the settlement for the new families, Gwyn must come to a place where she is able to accept the change and uncertainties of her future.This book was so surprising with it's villainous character and the twists and turns that ensued.

Seriously, I was hella entertained as Jet and Violet get pulled into a whirlwind of addiction that collides with unstoppable lust, secrets and a chance for a future they never could have imagined.Okay so the quick of it is that Jet and Violet meet one night in the most unconventional sort of way...at a sex addicts anonymous meeting. O.o Now that...is gonna be interesting, right? ::snort:: And as they're drawn towards one another and start getting involved with each other the secrets they're both harboring start to cause a little trouble and it...gets a little messy.So. Have you ever finish a book and you just sit there for a second kinda wondering...did I like these two? Or rather, should I be liking these two...like I do? lol That's kinda how I landed with Violet and Jet. These two were pretty perfect for each other. They both manage to play fast and loose with the truth now and again and in the same general way though for different reasons. They're a bit damaged and struggling with who they are and their actions. She's a little bit of an over-reactor but she really does try to do what she think's is right and help those around her. And Jet. He's a little wild in his rocker ways. He's definitely not perfect but a bit flirty and definitely a bit smooth when he wants. And despite their individual flaws they're good for each other and really bring out the best in one another.The sex was hot but it was very limited. The title was pretty accurate. There's Wild, Then There's You. There really wasn't too much Wild happening in this one. Lots of tension and some nice lead up but only one real scene. It's a scorcher of a scene though.There's a good bit of drama and angsty-ness happening. Everyone in this one is kinda screwed up. Violets utter fear of becoming addicted to anything and her desire to fix everyone, all of those in her life--father, best friend, cousins, aunts--that just...do whatever the hell they want consequences be damned and expect her to pick up the pieces. Jet and his band and their less than savory ways. I really didn't want to like...any of them. But in the end most ended up winning me over. Jet and Violet both managed to grow and change into better people because of knowing each other. Gotta love that.Overall, while I wasn't quite as enamored with There's Wild, Then There's You as I was with the previous book I still enjoyed it quite a bit. Writing, pacing and emotional pull were all excellent. I was definitely in to this one and had a hard time putting it down despite my quibbles with the actual characters on a few points--like the secret they were each hiding. Just wasn't something I think should be messed with but that may just be me. If you like a bit of angsty romance mixed with humor and real life happenings definitely one to check out.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "3.5 stars!

Not having read books 1 through 4,  I will definitely have to go back and read them since I couldn&#8217;t put this one down. I was hooked from the first page to the last and didn&#8217;t want the book to end!This was a western romance set mainly in Texas but parts of the story took place in Pennsylvania. There&#8217;s a hunky cowboy, a granddaughter who comes home to save their family ranch and a feisty grandma to boot. What&#8217;s not to like since there was immediate chemistry between the cowboy, Creed, and the granddaughter, Sage, although they fought it as much as possible until they each realized what they were feeling. They were also very supportive of each other, even though they had just met, and tended to help each other whenever possible.The descriptions of the blizzard, the ranch, Sage&#8217;s paintings, the newly found pets and their kittens and puppies were so well described I felt I was there. Feeling the cold and wind, sinking into the snow when having to go out to take care of the ranch animals, and feeling the warmth of the fire transported me. The story and characters were well developed. There was laughter, tears, angst, sorrow, happiness, fighting and then making up along with romance and love. There was also nice closure with several happily ever afters and I&#8217;m happy to know I&#8217;ll be reunited with the characters in future books.If you haven&#8217;t read books by Brown before, give her a try. You&#8217;ll be glad you did. She&#8217;s definitely going to be one of my new favorite authors and her books will be added to my ever increasing TBR pile!Favorite Quote:  &#8220;I heard her voice again, Creed, and she&#8217;s fine.&#8221;Creed pulled her to his chest and tipped her chin up with his fist. &#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t she be? She&#8217;s doing exactly what she wants to do.&#8221; All the air left Sage&#8217;s lungs. She wanted her grandmother to come home and never leave again, but after only three days she didn&#8217;t want Creed to leave either. She wanted him to kiss her. She wanted to snuggle into his arms and listen to him describe her paintings to her.

[...]The gorgeous book cover strikes again: The Thinking Woman's Guide to Real Magic was beautiful on the outside and overwhelmingly underwhelming within the covers. Get some popcorn. We might be here a while.THE CHARACTERSI went into this book with a little bit of a misconception: I believed the protagonist would be a thinking woman. Strangely enough, English doctoral student Nora is anything but. She is stuck in a rut in her dissertation, her love life (her boyfriend ran off to marry some other woman) and she is thoroughly intimidated by her doctoral adviser, Naomi. Nora, essentially, has no backbone; she keeps this passive attitude throughout the story, letting the overworked plot pull her in every direction without showing an ounce of personality.Aruendiel, the magician that saves her life, has a bit more personality, but it is shown more often than not that women should stay in their place (shown in his attitude not only toward Nora, but Mrs. T, his housekeeper, as well as his fellow magician Hirizjahkinis (try to say that three times fast). He has a sort of charm in a gruff, cranky way, but it was overshadowed for me by his past (which could be considered a spoiler, so I won't go into detail. For those who have read this: seriously? That's a plot twist?).Ilissa was appropriately evil and her son, Raclin - Nora's 'fairy' prince - had all the creep factors: as soon as his character appeared in the scene, the hairs on the back on my neck stood up. There wasn't enough plot or character development to fully understand any of these characters, beyond their basic motivations.THE PLOTI almost returned The Thinking Woman's Guide to Real Magic to the library because the first fifty pages of the novel were absurd. Nora, upset from her discussion with her adviser and discovering her boyfriend is engaged to another woman, decides to hike up into the hills with a copy of Pride and Prejudice in her pocket while everyone else is sleeping. We are constantly told about her disdain for the novel (which made me like her a little less - P&P; is one of my favorites), but The Thinking Woman evolves in more ways than one into a shadow of Austen's work. Nora then, within these fifty or so pages, becomes enchanted by fairies, meets, marries and is pregnant with the increasingly creepy (that's the only word for him), Raclin. There's five hundred plus pages in this book. Couldn't we pace it out a little more?Neither the boyfriend nor the adviser ever cross Nora's mind again; the dissertation is merely a faint thought in the back of her mind. Nora barely thinks of her family and friends during her visit to the \"other world,\" something I find unbelievable. Her lack of backbone and constant passivity during not only her captivity with the evil fairies but her time with Areundiel is just irritating. Isn't she the \"thinking woman\" of the title?The Thinking Woman's Guide to Real Magic has many tiny plots that a) aren't resolved or b) don't have any impact on the story whatsoever.  Discovering Aruendiel's rather interesting love life had no impact on the plot. The romance mentioned in the book's blurb is nothing more than feelings which neither truly acts upon. The potential was there, but after reading about Areundiel's past, I just couldn't handle it.THE WRITINGHonestly, this book is simply too long. The issue with pacing was overwhelming. Half of these five hundred pages weren't necessary to the plot; more often than not, they were pages and pages of characters telling me how they feel instead of the author showing me. I want to see the characters develop instead of reading about Nora and Areundiel sitting in a dark room in the castle talking about it.The writing, in general, was okay. Barker created interesting atmospheres and moods that are more memorable than the characters. I was intrigued by the fairy world and Areundiel's castle, but it wasn't enough to make up for the book's other faults.THE VERDICTNot for me. I was truly disappointed in The Thinking Woman's Guide to Real Magic. The wooden characters, poorly constructed plot and bad pacing made the 563 pages feel like a struggle rather than a pleasure. Nora's lack of personality and her passive state made for a protagonist I couldn't bring myself to cheer for.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "\"The Thinking Woman\" Isn't Well Thought Out", "unixReviewTime": 1399507200, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2014"}

Here, the author focuses on taste and scent, whereas for a guy, it's usually about looks and feel.  I found the shift in perspective delightful, and the entire episode is so well written, with such vivid intensity and tremendous emotional highs and lows and risks and fears and exquisite joy and anguish.  It's just superb. I even made my wife read it :-)The technology in the book is...appropriate to the story line.  The integrated quantum communications link is sort of taken for granted and not explained (and how can quantum comms be disrupted by a nebula????), but generally, there are no glaring issues, and as stated, it helps establish the story, not subtract from it.  I'm totally in with where she is going on the tech side.I was disappointed in the length of the book.  As the author's first foray into this world of self-publishing, I can see wanting to dip a toe in the waters, but I am hating the trend of never finishing a story line and stringing it out into volume after volume (three in this particular case).  I miss the good old days when an author would write a book, with a beginning, middle, and end.Nonetheless. I look forward to Jennsen's continuation of this particular story, though how she can keep up the quality of Chapter 47 remains to be seen....", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredibly good characters", "unixReviewTime": 1398729600, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2014"}

Years before Dashiell had felt sorry for his precocious next-door neighbor and declared her his little sister. He has spent the meantime sowing his oats in archeological pursuits and wild living. Upon seeing Vivienne when he returns Dashiell realizes that his feelings for her are no longer sisterly. Vivienne realizes that she is still attracted to Dashiell, but she must marry John because her family is close to financial ruin. Our hero and heroine become embroiled in a mystery involving her aunt, his grandfather, a couple of whorehouse madams, and more. Twists and turns abound as Vivienne and Dashiell try (not very successfully) to fight their growing attraction and avoid entanglements that neither is free to enjoy. Vivienne&#8217;s impulsiveness and naivet&eacute; and Dashiell&#8217;s attempts to be a better man make for a lot of humorous adventures.I liked many, many things about Wicked Little Secrets. It was quirky, charming and laugh-out-loud funny in places. Susanna Ives has such great comic vision that I suspect she should be comedy screenwriter.

The book&#8217;s hilarious scenes were so accurately described that the reader could picture every movement. I cannot recall another book where a writer used visual imagery in quite the same way. The fun was not limited to action scenes; Ives injected plenty of humorous dialogue as well. Vivienne and Dashiell were both endearingly flawed characters. Far from being &#8220;large and in charge,&#8221; they were both emotional and a little goofy, making poor but well-intentioned decisions. There was a rather complicated mystery that unfolded during the story and it kept the reader&#8217;s attention. A secondary budding romance between his grandfather and her aunt was pretty close to adorable. Ives successfully managed to poke fun at religion without being irreverent. My only significant criticism of the book was that the writing was a bit choppy. It didn&#8217;t flow as nicely as I would have liked.

I must say that this was hands down another fantastic read from the amazingly talented Madeline Sheehan! I was at a loss for words for a while there, because I just loved this book so very hard! Now I will remind you that this is not a sweet romance. It is going to be gritty, raw, and unapologetic and you will likely laugh, cry, and have some anger issues all while reading Unbeloved. But just remember&#8230; Madeline doesn&#8217;t do the sweet stuff. So if that is your thing, I can tell you right now that you will not enjoy these books, but I will also tell you that you will be missing out on something amazing too. *shrug* It&#8217;s your loss! LolSo here is the sitch: For Dorothy, life has never been easy and the choices she has made have not always been the best. Unfortunately the heart wants what it wants though, and now she has found herself in love with two men but both have kept their relationship with her hidden in the shadows. Jace is the selfish one who already has his own wife and family, but still strings Dorothy along for years saying that he will eventually leave his wife. On the other side she has Hawk, who saw vulnerability in her relationship with his fellow club member and manipulated Dorothy into a secret relationship with him that resulted in their son. Now I&#8217;m sure as you&#8217;ve read in the previous books, this doesn&#8217;t turn out well for any of them, but that is where this story actually begins.I feel like Undeniable series is the total embodiment of what makes us human. You will experience pain, regret, tragedy, love, lust, sacrifice, heartbreak, selfishness, and so many more emotions that Madeline so eloquently conveys in her talented writing. But above it all, you will find a deep seeded hope that things will eventually work out for these characters too. It may not be in the way you would expect, but they have all made poor choices and suffered the even sometimes dire consequences too. Unbeloved is a bittersweet and exceedingly emotional story that will have you on the edge of your seat, and I promise you will not be able to put it down. I really cannot tell you enough how much I adore this series, and Madeline&#8217;s masterpiece that is the Undeniable series is one you really don&#8217;t want to miss.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Loved this one so much!", "unixReviewTime": 1405468800, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2014"}

The other--Bushkin--succeeds in further decimating whatever positive is left of the public's opinion of the legal profession by being the ultimate gofer, yes-man, complicit adulterer, and all-around kisser of the star's bottom and worshipper at the altar of the dollar.Bushkin's self-congratulating seems to know no bounds yet little acknowledgement is given to the advisors and experts who any fool knows guided him all the way. Bushkin's ego clearly grew right along with his bank account. As others have said, this book should be called The Name-dropping Henry Bushkin Revenge Book. I'll defend him by saying that when writing about Hollywood it is impossible to not name drop.Almost every page confirms the rumors that Carson was not someone to admire beyond his showmanship. He was the lousiest of fathers and a failure as a husband with a conscience as small as his talent was huge. Both men are extremely unlikeable but, even with all his flaws, Carson is vastly more likeable and, although rarely, pathetic.This is the ultimate payback book by someone who would probably just have ended up being a hack slaving away in a law office had fate not stepped in and inexplicably handed him a big fat golden egg.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Zero Stars for Bushkin but Five Stars for the Book", "unixReviewTime": 1389139200, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2014"}

However, I will stick with my original synopsis of the the book. ****SIDE NOTE****Not all books make me feel like I need to write a lengthy review. Some reviews are just a few lines because the book was just so-so. Sometimes the book just leaves me speechless and I could never do the book or author justice by writing a review.It&#8217;s different with Rule. This is a book I had sworn I&#8217;d never read because it was SO full of editing issues. I even told people NOT to read it. Then I read a friend&#8217;s review on Goodreads, and chatted with her about it, so I decided to give it a shot. She even loaned me the book on Amazon because she wanted me to read it, but didn&#8217;t want me to spend the money if I ended up hating it. She had the re-edited version which made the decision easier for me to go ahead and try it.I was pleasantly surprised at Rule and the overall writing. For a new author who just wanted to get her story and words out, I give her a pass (for the most part) for all the editing issues. After reading a little bit of her background on Facebook and interviews on found on the internet, I understand why the book is so full of editing issues. She just never thought it would garner any attention and she was famous and didn't even know it!I was easily able to follow the story for the most part. There were a few passages that were confusing, but they worked themselves out at some point. It was almost like at times like she was just telling the story like it was a conversation (conscious train of thought).I was instantly drawn in by the characters and the family dynamics. I was intrigued by all the Archer boys, especially Rule. I knew he was going to be a hard shell to crack. I&#8217;m always drawn to broody, tattooed boys. I hurt for him and the way his parents, especially his mother, blamed him for everything. She was not a likable character at all. I have to say I guessed early on about Rule&#8217;s twin brother&#8217;s &#8220;secret&#8221;. I loved how Shaw got him to fall in love with her, even if he never was able to say it to her out loud. They were meant to be and I wish they hadn&#8217;t had to waste so many years due to mis-understandings and secrets. Not everything was left tidy at the end. You know these two still have a lot of work to do, but in general there was a semblance of a HEA. There were a lot of characters in this book to love. Shaw and Rule had some great friends who were their family when their biological families failed them. I definitely could see the set up for future books with the cast of characters we met along the way.This could be superb book with a good editor. Some people are good at the story and writing, and not with the pulling it all together and editing. I'm proud of Jay for writing Rule, and sad at the same time that it's getting so much backlash (including my own) for the lack of editing. I recently read a new release by a famous author who writes a similar genre. The book was full of editing issues. She is a best-selling established author so it's more shameful for her to have a book with issues than a new un-known author. Ya Know?Was it a cleanly edited book? No. Did it have run on sentences and missing or misspelled words? Yes. HOWEVER, she has never done this before. She was passionate about her story and felt like she had to get it out there for everyone to read. I believe Jay Crownover has learned her lesson. She has editors and publishers all lined up for the other books in the Marked Men series. And I can&#8217;t wait!p.s. I was loaned this book as mentioned before.

Darren", "helpful": [5, 13], "reviewText": "A humour-filled look at what was a serious matter (serious health problems) and the changes that were made for the better is what this hybrid autobiography/self-help/recipe book is, albeit with a sticker price that you might need a sense of humour to stomach at first glance.For fans of the Howard Stern radio programme, author Robin Quivers will be no stranger, playing straight woman to some of Howard&#8217;s excesses. What is perhaps less known is the author&#8217;s major struggles with her diet that doomed many of her relatives to obesity, diabetes and heart disease &#8211; things were not exactly a riot for her either. One day the hammer came down, a decision was taken and the start of a plant-based diet, a vegetation was born. This is her story.The author mixes personal testimony, opinion, science and advice carefully together with the dexterity of a master chef, managing to make the story compelling, interesting and accessible even to this most-dedicated meat-eater of a reviewer. What is particularly pleasing to this professional sceptic is the conditioned use of humour. Far too many books of this genre start off with what appears to be a bit of a tirade. The reader is lectured to and hectored about their previous &#8220;wrong&#8221; lifestyle choice and told that there is only one clear way to future salvation, their way. Think of a stereotype of a rather irritating preacher in a shopping mall and you get the message. No such worries here with this author, reading it was at times heavy going but still a pleasure nonetheless.There is a lot of information. A heck of a lot, one is not even at the stage of getting ready to detox, let alone cook. Yet things do not feel verbose or padded out. One can sense the enthusiasm and excitement that the author holds to the subject, emboldened no doubt by her own successes and perceived benefits. This is not meant to sound sarcastic or be an act of ridicule. This reviewer wasn&#8217;t swayed to change his lifestyle direction but it would be fair to say that certainly by remaining open-minded a lot of information was subsumed that will, in part, lead to subtle modification in one way or another. One person&#8217;s change is another person&#8217;s modification. The approach taken by the book didn&#8217;t alienate so there was a greater impetus to read and possibly learn, even if one doesn&#8217;t agree with everything.Once you have examined and possibly undertaken the detoxification stage, there is still a lot more advice given as to changing your behaviour and hopefully following a new pathway rather than just yet another fad. There is no follow-by-numbers programme. You need to read through it for yourself, digest the information, want to change and make the changes. Maybe you won&#8217;t go the whole hog at first, or ever, or maybe you will be instantly sold on the way forward. At least with this book&#8217;s approach both ways are acceptable. There is probably no wrong answer. As you delve deeper and deeper into the book you can begin to understand why it is priced as it is. In a positive way it feels that it will never end. The recipes are detailed, contain everything you need in clear to understand blocks, there is even an estimation of the preparation and cooking times! Measures are sadly in American imperial units only though and not every dish has its own photograph. Small whinges. The book&#8217;s price is a bit of an issue unless you know you really are ready for a change and will at least try to change, otherwise it could be a bit of an expensive whim purchase. When looking at the various recipes again it could still function also as a good alternative recipe book for someone who isn&#8217;t &#8220;signed up to the programme&#8221; but as a spur-of-the-moment purchase it might just require a thought too many. Sure, you have to pay for quality but the higher the price the more discretionary the purchase can often be.Reviewing a book of this kind is always difficult, particularly if you are not going to undertake a given programme. It is easier when you are sceptical towards the whole vegetarian movement, as a dedicated meat eater, even if you can accept an alternative point of view and remain objective anyway. It would be fair to say that this is one of the better, more convincing, more encompassing alternative dietary lifestyle/vegetarian books that this reviewer has considered. It is not shouty and in your face, it certainly seems to deliver on many levels and it has a great self-effacing humour shining throughout thanks to the author displaying her &#8220;warts and all&#8221; life story. A book worthy of serious consideration, whether you want a lifestyle change, a bit of a tune-up or just fancy something different that could be good for you.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pleasingly different", "unixReviewTime": 1389571200, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2014"}

On the upper middle of the page was a square illustration. It was small but did it's job. The illustrator was very creative and the kids loved looking at the illustration. As I began to read and then turn the page, there was nothing but text. This was a little disturbing. Basically the app ran out of space and had to finish the text on the following page. I would suggest that the book be re-formatted or more of the adorable illustrations be added.As for the story line, it was okay. It is about a boy named Terry. Terry wants to find friends to share his treehouse with. Terry sets out but one after another they are all way to busy doing chores or activities. Finally sad as can be, Terry heads home. On his way home, he sees his fellow kitty stuck in a tree. Only after he climbs the tree and rescues the kitty, does everyone play with him.The lesson really bothered me. What I got from it, was that if you do something for your friends, they will want you otherwise you are a loner. I think friendship should be two ways. For example Terry should have offered to collect the eggs to help speed up the chores before heading back to the tree house together.This book is not a total loss. As I read it to my kids, I actually ask them what should have been done. This is an okay book and the price is right.

A story of second chances and how some people can change the course of your life.Jean, a widow going through a tough time, mourning her husband and now she has a group of six women who meet the second Tues of every month for dinner, wine, and lots of laughs, and of course books.Of course it was a book club; and they were there for the books, not the food; however Jean realizes the ladies (herself included) look for more than a rekindling love of reading--they need a welcome distraction from their lonely or boring lives, not to mention the food!

Dorothy always worries about her troubled sons, causing her stress. Janet is rather shy and overweight, and being abused by her boss. May is younger and quite the entertainer with her dating stories.

Goodman has the background & experience to truly be branded as an expert, and he does not disappoint with up-to-date tips that can help turn any marketer's efforts (I'd say beginner to intermediate level) into potential gold. Plenty of links to follow for further information and I checked them all - 100% quality content. Goodman is apparently just getting started & his upcoming books should be additional proof that he is a leader in his field. Facebook, in particular, gets analyzed from an insider perspective and the author's advice appears to be on target with the short-term results I've already received.

Tornados and storms hit with a vengeance and many lose their lives. But there are those who survive only to be pulled from the wreckage and killed by a madman. Hershel, the Stormchaser, is out to make everyone pay for the death of his wife Louise. Help didn&#8217;t come quick enough when the horrible storms hit and they were stuck on the roof of their ravaged home. Louise died. Hershel blames the government and everyone who didn&#8217;t come to their aid.It&#8217;s not Hershel&#8217;s nor the FBI team&#8217;s first go-round. Tate, Wade, and Cameron butt heads with Hershel a year prior when he first began his lonely road of retribution. The FBI team wasn&#8217;t able to catch him then and now Hershel is back again, just as the storms are.Only this time FBI Agent Jo Luckett is added to the team. Jo is Wade&#8217;s ex-wife and it makes for some uncomfortable situations. They lost their unborn baby years ago and guilt, anger, hurt, and betrayal tore them apart. Do they still love each other and will it be enough to mend old wounds?Hershel is angry about Jo&#8217;s presence. It screws up his team. She wasn&#8217;t part of the hunt last year and now that she is, Hershel is thrown for a loop. He must get rid of her. Will Jo and Wade finally settle their long and hurtful animosity or will Hershel kill Jo before she and Wade can make amends?These are a few questions I had while zooming through this book. There are tense situations throughout, as well as astonishment as I read Hershel&#8217;s dialogue with his dead wife. He&#8217;s part crazy and part intelligent. The mixture of the two makes for one hell of a thriller.If Sala was going for a terrorizing, thrilling, hard to put down, intense novel, she hit the nail on the head.

I wanted to take him home with me. I wanted to make him safe. Then I fell in love with him. I admired the man he was. A good man with a good heart.  Doing the right thing no matter how hard it was.One of the hard things was waiting for Alyssa Kincaid to grow up. I think he fell in love with her when he first saw her when she was fifteen. He watched her grow up, seeing her once a year, hearing about her from Alec, waiting and watching.  Until finally, they come together. Oh my, that was a good scene. I loved when he told her &#34;If we do this, you are mine&#34;. He hadn't even kissed her! I was holding my breath. What would she say? Of course her answer was perfect.All the steamy scenes in this book are excellent. I love the way this author writes love scenes - so real.  Not &#34;50 Shades&#34; real but really testing the limits. I love how honest Joe and Alyssa are about what they each want.Another thing she does is let us catch up with the characters from the first two books. I love seeing what is going on with Gabe and Mira and Alec and Rae. This is a great family. I would love to see more of them. Surely they have a cousin for Joe's sister, hint.

Before I say anything else, you need to know that these are not stand alone novels. You must read book one (Born of Persuasion) in order to follow the plot continued in book two. Believe me, you will want to read both, as this is a thrilling series!Mark of Distinction continues the story of Julia Elliston, a woman who becomes known as the Emerald Heiress. She is a woman who seems to have no control over her own life, being manipulated at every turn by many who do not have her best interest in mind.The story itself is narrated by Julia as she nears the end of her life and looks back to her youth. She wants her story to be told...and what a story!There is mystery, intrigue, and suspense throughout. Many of the characters in the first book return, in addition to new characters, most of whom can't be trusted. Some are just plain evil!Lord Pierson is protecting Julia from the evil Mr. Macy...or is he? He has plans of his own for Julia and those plans are to use her to his own advantage. He is a cold, calculating man.Julia is still in love with Edward Auburn, a man of faith who is one of the only truly good influences in Julia's life. She will never forget him, but is kept from him as she becomes more deeply entangled in the schemes of others around her. Another character, Lord Dalry, seems to treat Julia with kindness, but nothing is as it seems in this book!This novel is so good I could not stop reading! Each page drew me deeper into Julia's life. Jessica Dotta has such talent, and tells a tale much like classics by the Bronte sisters. I highly recommend Mark of Distinction.The final book in this trilogy is scheduled for release next year.

They landed in New York and anyone with a basic knowledge of history knows that this country did not welcome all of its immigrants with open arms. The Irish were particularly reviled at the period in which this book takes place and Norah is doing all she can to erase her roots from her being. She is working hard to make money, to make something of herself so she can move out of the Five Points neighborhood that so defines her.Norah is very headstrong, very controlling and sure she knows it all. As with most young people she does not think that anyone knows better than she and she is not very willing to accept direction or criticism and this has her finding herself over and over and over again in situations that could have been avoided. This drove me a bit batty as a reader because you would have thought that she might have started learning after a bit. She ultimately did but it took her a long, long time.The beauty of this book lies in the history; it's well researched and deftly presented - the good, the bad and the downright ugly. It was not a pretty time in history and it was not a pretty neighborhood in New York. Ms. Neale does not spare her readers and this is very important in the delivery of the immigrant experience.

This is the effect Mr King has on your consciousness when he is in top form.  And he is certainly back to his best in Mile 81.To be honest, the story starts off slowly.  A group of school aged boys head off to explore the local town boundaries as well as some metaphorical ones, leaving the younger brother of one exposed to the ills of isolation.  Following his heart instead of his head, said boy finds himself breaking into a closed down restaurant, drinking some left over alcohol and falling asleep.  The chills for the reader arrive when Mr King decides to play on your emotions as well as bring in some delightfully effective tools used in manipulating your brain cells.Parts two and three of the story are less chilling but we witness the first visitation of  hard core horror.  We witness Mr King enjoying himself by killing off two (somewhat short lived) cast members in very gruesome and original ways and it is here that the reader begins to wonder how the story will end.This is a great purchase.  Like I have already mentioned, it is gruesome, chilling and only a little violent.  Everything is handled in a very sophisticated and intelligent manner.

So I anticipated with bated breath his latest book &#34;To Rise Again at a Decent Hour.&#34; I have to say that even after reading the book and re-reading parts of it again, I am still not totally sure what the title has to do with the book itself.  But no matter--the book was very good and a very worthwhile read--if not a bit quirky in usual Ferris fashion.The book is about a man named Paul O'Rourke, a self-proclaimed atheist who is an extremely successful dentist and a huge Red Sox fan.  He has a successful practice in New York City with a staff that is devoted to him if not somewhat incredulous around his beliefs and how he treats them including his secretary and office manager who was his one time girlfriend who he is still enamored with.  One day, Paul operates on an odd patient who makes several proclamations before leaving the office.  Almost immediately. Paul's entire life is hacked and he is impersonated online in almost every forum possible including Facebook and Twitter. What starts as an innocuous web site turns into &#34;Paul&#34; making religious proclamations--many of them severely anti-Semitic in nature. Paul doesn't know what to do or how to turn off this impersonation that seems to be ruining and certainly altering his life.  And it gets worse and worse by the day.  He finally is introduced to the group that he believes is the cause of his problems--the Ulms- a fringe religion started by a covert to Judaism.In typical fashion, Ferris keeps the book moving along with tons of opportunity to laugh--and even cry a bit.

There is a lot of information on the beginning of the passenger jet age, in particular the rise and fall of Pan Am, but the greater bulk of the writing is about the people who belonged to the Jet Set, not even necessarily while riding in those planes. Much of the information tells who was sleeping with who, who was divorcing whom. Sex remains the number one subject.The author claims pilots imitated John Wayne, quite frankly it seems many developed the aw shucks drawl of Chuck Yeager.  One also wonders at the factual accuracy when we are informed Truman lived at the Mayflower Hotel during the White House renovations. He did stay there for 90 days but then moved into the Blair House for 4 years which is never mentioned. Also in one section the movie The Swan which starred Grace Kelly is cited as being released on the same day as her wedding in 1955, then 30 pages later we read that to Catch a Thief was released for her wedding in 1956.There are just too many times that it just seems as if information is stuck in to demonstrate as many facts as possible can be shoved into the pages. For example the roots of the Jet Set are given as the address where the Empire State building now stands, then King Kong is mentioned and the B-25 bomber that crashed into it, then the subject quickly changes to the Astor ballroom and it is compared to the fallout shelters of the 50's.The multitude of names and marriages and divorces becomes convoluted at times, one feels they need a score card. One also should have a scorecard to keep up with the name Igor Cassini. We cannot escape the author's fascination with this brother of Oleg the fashion designer. It almost seems as if the book is about Igor. He is mentioned in page after page...if he would have kept his column the writing would have been better, the scandals surrounding him helped to bring down the Jet Set, he did this, he lived there, on and on page after page. Of course that is possible with the time skips.

When Marcy sees the $100 bill on the floor of the casino her mind goes into overdrive. Off the bat she says she is a single Mom, has a loser ex husband, is basically living hand to mouth, and has the decency to remember her upbringing and tell the Texan cowboy he dropped it. When he tells her that he wishes it was the only thing he lost at the casino he tells her that this is a reward for being honest. She is floored because that is a lot of money for a casino worker. We learn that author creates Marcy as a good girl who lives by the rules. That said she is thankful for the little she has and he daughter Katie. I love the way the author creates Marcy and then goes further to explain things about her and Vegas. So we know in Vegas it is not easy for a divorced Mom to find a cheaper place to live or even a room mate that doesnt have a drug problem, is a stripper, or a prostitute.  All of this  starts a SLOW moving chain of events in Marcy's life. Just think to yourself how many times you heard &#34;Your mother raised a great boy, girl, insert name here**&#34; THAT is Marcy and she is seemingly fine with the bad hand she is dealt. She is thankful she had a great Mom and since cancer took her Marcy has tried to rebound. She is grateful for her child even though Trent (insert every bad name for a penis you can =here) is a loser in every way imaginable, he gave her Katie.There is the next character that I LOVE and now I will explain Andre Chevalier. He is a dream, older, built, sophisticated man speaking with a French accent while inserting moi wherever he can. That alone just makes irresistible in every way. This man can charm your panties right off you before you are aware that they are falling down you leg. For this character I will use the word PERFECTION. Why? well he is a relationship and sexual counselor. Yes he knows a woman's body and he teaches couples what is wrong with their sex life, love life, and shows them how to fix it. He does have another power aside from melting panties, he has the greatest intuition ever. He meets Marcy and his mind goes to his security expert and friend Mike Thompson. He thinks to himself, Mike and Marcy would be great. Then he thinks their names sound good together. He immediately decides to offer Marcy a job,  this is the dream job she has always wanted so she is given a time and told to call by 9am and if not the job isnt hers. He doesnt really need her. He has a job but more one he has created for her. He seems in her a woman who needs a break. Andre wants Mike, his security team leader to interview and approve Marcy. Andre is so confident that Mike will be smitten with Marcy. I was too. That is the best part of this story!NOW for Mike. He lost his wife before they were able to have a child to cancer. He is extremely focused on work. He is a great guy, great brother, uncle and most of all son. Another spoiler her- his mother is treated well. So you know if they treat their mother well they will do the same for a wife. hhmmmm Trent never saw his mother, she lived in Florida and he could care less. Tells a lot about his character.I loved every single page of this book. I want to scream about the &#34;lessons&#34; that Andre teaches Marcy, but it MUST be read. If ever there was a book that has great lessons for both men and woman this is it. I want to say that one little choice by Marcy starts a slow moving chain of events that creates the BEST book for me this year. I want everyone to read it.

It is a storybook.  To write a story requires the author to choose a perspective and stick with it.  Read this knowing you do not get anything like a detailed portrait of the available information on any one topic.  Read it knowing you get the author's choice of interpretation and a selection of the supporting and competing information that is available, but only to the extent that would support an enjoyable and absorbing STORY.Further, Bauer is mainly concerned with written documentation.  This is not, in and of itself, a problem, but the impression one gets is that the stories, documents and mythologies of a people are more or less homogeneous across time and space and therefore can be considered at close to face value.  Obviously this is a very tricky thing.  Consider ancient Egypt: at any time in Egyptian history, perspectives on their own past varied; a written document shows not so much anything reliable about its topic, but about the life and times of its author.Bauer is aware of the limitations of her method.  I would not say that this book in any way misrepresents what it in fact offers.  I do disagree with her interpretations in quite a few areas, but I don't object to her method and I can read the book with the &#34;ifs, ands, and buts&#34; in the back of my mind because I'm aware of the additional information out there on the topics.  I still find the book helpful for its broad focus, and worth reading.In other words, if the transition to agricultural economies, for example, is an area of prehistory that fascinates you, do move on to textbooks and learn how much more information is out there, as well as how much less certain any particular viewpoint on the period actually is.

Together, mother and child learn how pornography can poison your mind and the powerful, addictive control it can have over you (often times more so than substance abuse).  Mother teacher son how to recognize pornography, how it affects your brain and body, how little bodies react when innocent eyes see it, the different parts of the brain that are affected, and a plan to help fight it&#8217;s influence.  Dad reenforces the lessons given and adds his perspective.  Using the imagery of &#8220;the thinking brain&#8221; and &#8220;the feeling brain&#8221; you and your child can easily talk about how pornography often times leads to addictions, dehumanization, and lies.  I was amazed at how well this book tackled this difficult subject.  In the introduction the authors list the reasons for writing this book, tell you how the book is organized, and how to use it.  It is written in a way that can appeal to parents of children of ALL ages.  There is no graphic content and it can be easily understood by children young and old, regardless of their knowledge of the reproductive system.There are so many things about parenting that no one warns you about.  How to protect your kids from the pervasive influence of pornography is one of them.  We know very well how we need to be proactive in protecting our children from physical harm, kidnapping, molestation, etc.; protecting them from their own minds and destructive behaviors is just as important.  Teach your boys AND your girls (this is no longer an exclusively male issue) how to recognize pornography, flee from it when they see it, and (most importantly) to be open and honest with you when it happens&#8230; because in this day and age, it&#8217;s not a matter of if&#8230; but when.{I received a copy of this in exchange for a review.

The blurb sounded so interesting, but, honestly, I really didn&#8217;t pay much attention to it. Thankfully, I was not disappointed. What a pleasant surprise this was. I fell into this story from the get go and could not put it down until the end.This wastes no time getting into the thick of things when Micah and his sister find themselves in the Faerie King&#8217;s bedroom hoping to strike a deal. Unfortunately, they did not count on just how much of a bastard the King really is, though Micah finds out soon enough. The King basically imprisons him, uses and abuses him. I felt so bad for Micah and his situation at this point.Then we meet Inigo, not to be confused with Inigo, you have killed my father, prepare to die, Montoya from The Princess Bride. No, Inigo is a talented tattooing vampire. What a fabulous character he is! He is charming, funny and sexy all rolled into one. Inigo is brought to Faerie to tattoo the King (there is much more behind this part of the story). Things do not go according to plan, and tables get turned. When he and Micah are thrown in together, they just clicked, even though they meet under such dire circumstances. These guys were so funny, especially Inigo, who had me laughing out loud more than once. Their dialog was such a joy to read. They basically decide to trust each other, team up and end up falling in love.This leans a bit more toward fantasy with much of it taking place in Faerie with portals to the real world. I found this to be refreshing and entertaining, even with the harder to read scenes when the King is being a sadistic bastard. I had not read the prequel to this, Jumping in Puddles, though I understand this is a standalone.

Brown is a high octane version of the old pulp thrillers.Frank Shaw, the protagonist, is an ex Green Beret who worked security for the wrong side and served time for voluntary manslaughter. Now released and attempting to do everything correct, he is accompanied by Tony, his sister's 17-year-old son who always has idolized him, when he unexpectedly receives a visit from his former cell mate, Ed Meese, a particularly depraved ex-con. Ed wants to exchange cars and while discussing the matter, Tony finds a young woman bound in Meese's trunk and releases her. While Frank is otherwise engaged, Ed, accompanied by Jesus Coroza, a cartel member, discover the escape, capture them both and take off followed by Frank. It seems the woman was a vigilante fighting a child slavery ring which is a large part of the cartel's activity. The chase is extended, action continuous, often violent and includes numerous miscalculations, wrong guesses and unexpected complications. Frank acquires unexpected aid from a cookie baking accountant, a Mormon farmer/rancher with an old Cesena and his friend.This book is great for individuals who were/are attracted to the old pulp thrillers and without a doubt the over-the-top action has appeal.

They are so well written. Ace and London are super hot together!Plot/Storyline- Okay, the plot and story were AMAZING! I couldn't put the book down. The love story (not your conventional hearts and flowers relationship, but I loved that) was awesome and the added drama and action just made this story addictive. It was a great emotional and mental ride ;)Steam Factor- Get out your sham wow panties!! Ace KNOWS how to please a woman and things get down and dirty at times. Raw and hot as hell!!Cover- Sexy, just like ACE!!Cliffhanger- Nope. This is a standalone. No HEA though.Overall- I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY enjoyed this book... all the way up to the end. The end just deflated the whole story for me. The entire book was great and very well written, but I'm a HEA person and this book doesn't deliver for that need.We meet London, who happens to be a walking bad luck charm. Everyone around her dies. First her parents, then her brother, and others. Her whole life is quite upsetting and just one bad circumstance after another.  The loss of her parent's is the reason her brother, Jonah, starts to work for Ace in order to make lots of money to support London with her expenses (housing and college); despite it being illegally earned.  Things go wrong during an exchange and London is left alone with no living relatives.Ace and Jonah were pretty close so Ace takes London in under his wing after Jonah passes.  There is a lot more that goes on between Ace and Jonah that you find out throughout the story and explains the REAL reason why Ace takes in London after Jonah's passing, but I won't go into that so that you can enjoy the story yourself.When Ace and London interact, there is a strong attraction and they both lust for each other. The sexual tension is fun to read as well as the actual sex. Their sexual interactions are so raw and primal and sexy as hell. Ace makes me want to start dressing in silk and pearls.... wink,wink.The story's ability to pull you in with the love story and the action/suspense aspect was perfectly executed.  The writing was spot on with plot/story details and character development. I was consumed with the story and was happy with the flow and delivery throughout the entire book. There was never a moment where I wanted to set the book down unless I had to. That was... until the end!! I wanted to throw my iPad and then call Shanora myself and ask her why she would just keep dealing London a rotten hand in life. The ending was so frustrating, but I am an HEA addict, so if you're good with an ending that doesn't end happily (because not all stories do, but I avoid them) then I HIGHLY recommend you read this book because the story is AMAZING and you will love it!!Shanora, I tip my hat to you in your amazing ability to tell a story. I ate up every last word and was able to fully lose myself in your story, BUT the ending girl!! I needed an HEA after all the crap London had to deal with in life, I needed it for me and for her.

Oster&#8217;s clear, concise prose and knack for explaining complicated concepts (like comparing grocery shoppers using feel and color to guess at the ripeness of a melon to doctors using the nuchal translucency scan and a simple blood test to guess at the genetic normalcy of a fetus) make the book a quick and easy read despite the scientific subject matter. She generally lives up to her stated commitment to data and resistance of both bias and anecdote in a truly impressive manner. And some of Oster&#8217;s conclusions are downright revelatory, like when she debunks bedrest and distinguishes between food restrictions based on danger to the fetus (i.e., raw meat, unwashed produce, raw-milk cheeses, and deli turkey) and those based on bacteria that &#8220;are no worse when you are pregnant than when you are not&#8221; (i.e., sushi and raw eggs). I, for one, will be eating sushi standing up.Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve got quite a few bones to pick with the book. First, Oster gets a little carried away with marketing her conclusion that &#8220;pregnancy rules are . . . sometimes flat-out wrong.&#8221; In the introduction, for example, she writes &#8220;pick up a cup of coffee or, if you like, a glass of wine, and read on&#8221; and only later - after I had downed a glass of wine during my first trimester - adds caveats like the glass should contain a modest pour, not be fortified, be drunk slowly, and less so in the first trimester than the second and third. Garr. Second, it appears that her own biases impact the &#8220;Bottom Line&#8221; summary section at the end of each chapter when the evidence is mixed; in the case of prenatal yoga, she recommends the practice, but when it comes to side-sleeping, she&#8217;s a bit more negative. Maybe there&#8217;s some nuance to the mixed data in each case that she didn&#8217;t explain (or I didn&#8217;t understand), but I got the impression that she didn&#8217;t quite maintain the level of objectivity she set out to meet. Third, Oster writes &#8220;large randomized studies have shown that vaginal delivery of breech babies is slightly riskier than a planned C-section&#8221; after complaining about vague and opaque statements from her doctor (&#8220;I asked my doctor about drinking. She said that one or two drinks a week was &#8216;probably fine.&#8217; &#8216;Probably fine&#8217; is not a number.&#8221;). How is a woman who is opposed to a C-section supposed to decide whether the risk to her breech baby justifies scheduling one based on &#8220;slightly&#8221;? I understand that she can&#8217;t drill down all the numbers on all topics, but then why address this one? Fourth, Oster too eagerly ignores nuance and divides folks into &#8220;natural childbirth people&#8221; and medicalized mamas, like by lumping routine episiotomies in with the latter despite her own statement that only an OB who hasn&#8217;t &#8220;read the medical literature in the last 20 years&#8221; would practice them. Fifth, I found the &#8220;Beyond Pain&#8221; chapter disappointingly anecdotal and out of step with the rest of the book. Finally, Oster should acknowledge that a lot of people don&#8217;t want the numbers or the responsibility of making a close call; yes, blanket rules can be seen as infantilizing of those who do, but there has to be room in obstetrics for both types of expectant mother.Luckily for Oster, each of these problems could be fairly easily fixed in a second edition, and none of them take away from her tremendous accomplishment: writing a smart, informative, and easy-to-read guide to the decisions expectant mothers must make which I highly recommend, handful of warts and all.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Smart, informative pregnancy primer", "unixReviewTime": 1393113600, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2014"}

As a fictionalized memoir, it's a solid and emotional read. Twain gets his into characters as the aged friend of Joan's who is still deeply affected by her in his old age. The book is written with passion, fervor, and heart as he describes the greatness and the goodness of Joan of Arc.The book is moving and exciting. Twain did extensive research and he's able to take the best of the official record and bring to light a compelling story.Twain does well with his portrayal of Joan's fictional friends. While it may be true that they sound more like they come from Hannibal than medieval France, they are entertaining and fun to read.The book's what you'd expect from a skeptic and borderline cynic. Modern treatments of Joan of Arc try to dismiss her as a mentally disturbed woman. A mentally disturbed teenager who turned the course of the 100 year wars but still---George Bernard Shaw preferred to pretend the tribunal was a legitimate religious tribunal so that he could castigate religion. Twain opts to put his irreverence in check to point out the trial was illegal because Joan had been examined by a superior religious court prior to this, and that throughout the trial the clerics acted as political agents of the English and violated numerous procedures in their kangaroo court.What Twain and the rest of us are left with in Joan of Arc is a remarkable case. While many lives of the Saints from the Middle Ages were subject to countless embellishments over the centuries through oral retellings and the mixing of legends, Joan is a unique case. As Twain notes, her life is a matter of record, of sworn testimony in three trials.And what we're left with is the story of an illiterate, untaught untrained teenage girl who turned the tide of the nearly hopeless French cause, showing wisdom far beyond her years. She spoke like a prophet, loved like an angel, and died like a martyr. Twain didn't try to debunk her, disprove her, or diminish her.

It is a short story about a case of mistaken identity.  This is the story of Ainsley and Marcus.  Ainsley is a woman who has been left by her long time lover and no longer feels like she is attractive. She has decided to order herself a special treat this Valentine&#8217;s Day.  Marcus is a young CEO and widow who does not want to be reminded that it is Valentine&#8217;s Day.  However, when he is asked to make a special last minute delivery this will turn out to be the most interesting Valentine&#8217;s that either of them has ever had.I enjoyed the idea that this story presented, not all stories have to have a young woman as the lead.  It was refreshing to see a slightly older woman finding love and happiness with a younger man.  The characters in this story were very easy to connect with, however I would have enjoyed a little more back-story on both of them to get to know them a little better.  This is one of the few books that I have read lately that there really was not any type of conflict in the story.  I have to say that this was definitely a different type of read for me.  I would give this book 4 stars and look forward to reading more from Kate Deveaux.ARC provided by author for review", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good story", "unixReviewTime": 1401408000, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2014"}

All fourteen stories were scorching hot, and anything you've probably heard about cowboys come true in this sizzling collection. All of them were M/F and very erotic with graphic sex and language. If you don't like the \"c\" word, you might not enjoy some of the stories. If I had to rate each one individually, the majority would rate between 4 or 5 stars. If you love sexy cowboys who treat their women right, are true gentlemen, and well endowed then you'd be crazy to pass this up. Get it, I promise you will not regret it. Mine is going on my nightstand.Mrs. Morgan and the Marshal by Emma Jay - A dalliance with the sexy town marshal makes a woman rancher question which she wants most, her independence or him.Very romantic and hot. I loved that Sybil stood her ground and made her boundaries clear. I also loved that Addison wasn't intimidated by her desire to retain her independence and made a gesture so grand, she couldn't refuse him.Remember by Mia Hopkins - A jilted bride saddles up with the blazing-hot cowboy stripper hired for her cancelled bachelorette party.Oh my! This sexy, dirty-talking stripper has the moves and the goods to make Eliza both forget and remember everything. With a member as thick as her wrist and balls the size of peaches .... you'll have to read the book to learn the rest. Multiple positions just draw out this delicious torture, and I'm not talking about the heroine.Cowboy Downtime by Cheyenne Blue - Passion ignites at a polocrosse game in the Australian outback--she plays attack, he plays defense, and their sexy wager decides the winner.Another scorching hot story. I loved their competitiveness and flirtatiousness with one another. That obviously translated very well to other activities.Coming Home by Megan Mitcham - A busted-up rodeo champion finds the squirt he tormented in youth transformed into a fiery woman challenging him to become the man she deserves.What a sweet story of friends to lovers. I really liked sassy Scarlett and the way she bossed Barrett around, not allowing him to wallow in self pity. I understood why he waited so long to claim her, but dang it, I was ready to put the spurs to him for dragging it out. Sweet and hot!Her Captured Cowboy by Layla Chase - A lonely woman, ostracized by Colorado townspeople after years in Indian captivity, takes what she needs from a wandering cowboy.While the actions more than likely fit the time in which this was set, I felt a little uncomfortable with what came across as non-con on Bo's part in the beginning. For a romance, I think the first scene toed the line a little. However, Meghan's quick turnaround between being selfish and realizing what she was doing wasn't right redeemed her in time. This one was just okay for me.Back Stage Pass by Cynthia D'Alba - A sexy night with a hired escort, who looks exactly like a woman's favorite country singer, leaves her with a back stage pass and a lot of burning questions.This was so funny it was brilliant! Laughing aside, the escort had a deliciously wicked side to him that made for one hot birthday present.Unfinished Business by Cat Johnson - A class reunion gives one woman a second chance with a sultry cowboy from her past.Skye and Rowdy don't beat around the bush. Another scorching hot story. Fast and sexy.At the Mercy of the Cowboy by Amber Lin - A new farmhand finds rough living and an even rougher cowboy to soothe away her pain.You can't go wrong with an Amber Lin story. Ever. What should be a simple story of two characters bearing some painful burden, it somehow feels heavy with her special brand of poetic prose. Beautifully written and so hot.Cowboy Adonis by Michael Bracken - When a naked cowboy rises from a stock pond, a nature photographer's assignment gets personal.The shortest story thus far but no less hot. I enjoyed their flirtatious banter and mature confidence.Denim and Lace by Robie Madison - One woman in a pair of rhinestone heels plus two sexy cowboys equals a highly combustible combination.A menage, kind of, and definitely the tamest story so far. I liked the boldness of the heroine and Clay definitely seemed more of her speed.One Track Cowboy by Delilah Devlin - After tracking two lost hikers, a park ranger and a local rancher lose themselves to a wild passion.Zane's standoffish behavior really ratcheted up the sexual tension. Their joining was wild to say the least (fist time I've come across fisting in a romance). Ridiculously hot story, and I love a dominant cowboy.Skin Deep by Randi Alexander - A pretty city girl and a scarred country cowboy discover love waits when you're ready to look beneath the surface.I have nothing but love for this story. A western twist on The Beauty and the Beast. I love characters that can find someone who will accept them as they are, scars and all. Their connection made for a deeply sensual joining.Drop Two Tears in a Bucket by Shoshanna Evers - Alone on her Montana cattle ranch after her husband divorces her, a woman finds satisfaction in the arms of the one cowboy she can't resist.A quick fast read, and I liked the older heroine, younger hero scenario.A Cowboy for Delilah by Sabrina York - The last thing this independent, high-powered lawyer wants is a cowboy in her life, but one steamy kiss from a sexy rancher burns her resolve to a crisp.Ms. York delivers once again with scorching hot sex and humor. Delilah is quite the spitfire, and I loved how the \"Neanderthal cowboy\" was blasting through her biases. The dining table sex was wicked.Shall We Dance? by Myla Jackson - When a lonely woman gives private dance lessons to a shy, sexy cowboy, she stumbles on passion worth fighting for.What a heart-warming, romantic quickie. This somewhat shy pairing was adorable and sensual during their dance lesson. I really liked it.Disclaimer: Complimentary copy provided by the publisher for an honest review.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fourteen ridiculously hot stories and cowboys who will melt your heart.

I am not Abnegation. I am not Dauntless. I am Divergent.&#8221;I bought this book about a year ago and starting reading it immediately. I don't know exactly what happened, whether I was distracted by something or simply forgot to carry on reading, but I never got further then the first 2 chapters. Since then I have never again got round to reading it until this week. I had been holing back, avoiding it for some reason, but I forced myself to read it, knowing that once I got into it, i was going to love it. I started reading it at about 10pm, I finished it at 2am.If you have read and liked the Hunger Games, then this book is definitely for you. It;s not the same story, but its the same kind of theme. Dystopian world, segregated into desperate factions (districts in HG) and a strong female lead.This book follows Tris as she leaves her faction and transfers to Dauntless. We follow her through her initiation and therefore get to watch her discover who she is and what she is capable off. I found her to be a likeable character, and she earns girl power points throughout the book when she starts to kick ass! Her romance interest, Four, is originally introduced to us as Tris' trainer, and its takes her a while to become aware to his feelings for her all the whilst we are shouting at our books for her to notice!. As part the initiation Tris and her friends must get put through simulations of their worst fears, but we also get to see Four's. The fact that he is not perfect and sightly vulnerable makes him even more love able.The initiation process for Tris is extremely difficult and Roth writes her action and fight scenes so well that when I read it I could see everything that was happening with the action, in my head, as if I were watching  a movie in my mind. I know that some people have complained that this book felt like one long initiation, but I really enjoyed it and didn't feel like it was dragged out at all. It was a good speed, flowed nicely and kept me pulled in for a good 4 hours until I had finished.My one criticism of this book would be that the whole time you are reading this you can feel something building up, you know that something is going to happen, which is does, but then before you can get stuck into this big thing that has happened the book is over. I get that the story is going to carry on into the second book, but still, I all just happened a bit quick for my liking.You can find more of my reviews and initial reactions videos at Broc's Bookcase ([...])", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing start to an Addictive series!", "unixReviewTime": 1400889600, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2014"}

I was fortunate that at one of our previous churches, the assistant pastor was born and raised a Jew and, as an adult, accepted Jesus.  He was very active in &#8220;Jews for Jesus&#8221;.  Our congregation learned a lot about the Jewish religion and the Old Testament from him.  Also, I have read and studied the Old Testament some over the years, but I am still far from knowledgeable about most of it.  I learned a lot while reading this book and am grateful for the opportunity to have found it.&#8220;The One Year Holy Land Moments Devotional&#8221; is an excellent source for information and wisdom from the Jewish and the Christian perspectives.  Since I was reading it for review, I read it straight through.  It was very easy to read as most weeks are tied together under a topic and the content flows smoothly.  I also really appreciate that there is a topical index in the back for reference so that I can use it at a later time to review some of my favorite topics.  Both writers did an excellent job.  Both the Jewish and the Christian perspectives are presented, as well as, their similarities and differences.Some Christians think that the Law and the Old Testament should be disregarded since Jesus came.  But Jesus said &#34;Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill the law&#8221; (Matthew 5:17).  If we are ignorant of the &#8220;law&#8221; how can we know what Jesus came to complete?  To be sure, one can be saved without that knowledge, but it helps us to understand the whole picture.Some of the things I learned while reading the book are:&#8220;Abraham became the first person to be called a Hebrew.  The word Hebrew comes from a word that means &#8220;side&#8221;.  The whole world was on one side, and Abraham was on the other.  The whole world believed one thing, but Abraham steadfastly believed something entirely different.  Abraham&#8217;s bedrock faith in the one true God is the very foundation upon which Jews and Christians alike have built their faith traditions.  His willingness to stand against the culture is a model for us all.&#8221;&#8220;Job realized that he never really had anything to lose in the first place.  Every human being enters this world with nothing and will leave with nothing.  Job said the Lord has given me what I had and the Lord has taken it away.  Praise the name of the Lord.&#8221; (Job 1:21&#8220;King David wrote I have CHOSEN to be faithful; I have DETERMINED to live by your regulations.&#8221;  Psalms 119:30There are many other things I learned, but you will just have to read the book and find wonderful bits of treasure for yourself.If you ever read devotionals and even if you don&#8217;t, I recommend this book as one you should add to your reading list.I was provided a free copy of this book for review from Tyndale Momentum.

Then I found myself unable to put it down.  Stanley Peke, the central figure, who at age 72, could not be written more perfectly - an unlikely hero who grows into the role simply and seamlessly.  And he is flawed as heroes in literature are.  I am not familiar with Mr. Stone, but he proves that the craft of writing remains alive and well - and that it isn't necessary to use 400 or 500 pages to create characters, events, action and emotion.  Moving day is a marvelous, in-depth character study for both Peke and for Nick, the thief against whom he is pitted; the action and suspense are plentiful. I might never have read this book had it not been offered to members of Amazon Prime in their Kindle First program.  I am extremely grateful.  Thank you Amazon.

I loved &#34;Running Home to You&#34;, book #2 of the &#34;Running series&#34;, every bit as much as I loved &#34;Running Back to You&#34;, book #1 of the &#34;Running&#34; series!&#34;The story of Evan and Juliette(Jette) picks up right where it left off in &#34;Running Back to You&#34; (Did I mention that I Love both Evan and Jette?)The relationship between Evan and Jette has moved forward and they seem to have moved past the trauma caused by Evan's crazy ex who kidnapped him and ended up severely injuring him. They are finally living together happily in Evan's beach house and their bar/restaurant 'Rush' is in the final stages of being finished. (And there love/sex life is still smokin' hot!)While Evan begins training with The New Jersey Sentinels football team, Jette spends all of her time making sure that every detail is perfect for the Grand Opening of Rush. She's also making sure that all of her staff (most of whom are her close friends)are ready for the big day.While all of this is going on author Suzanne Sweeney is also further developing characters that were secondary in the first book(Auggie, Emmy,Reese, Derek and Marcus). I already felt like the secondary characters from the first book were my friends but as the story progresses they begin to feel more like my family.While things look rosy on the outside there is trouble brewing on the inside. Evan is hiding his feelings from Juliette and he is also beginning to act in a bizarre manner creating tension between him and Jette.When things turn ugly between Evan and Jette I never gave up on them even when Jette moved out.I really enjoyed seeing more of Auggie in this book..although we didn't really hear much about him until about 25% of the way into the book. But from there on out he's infused throughout the rest of the story.I also enjoyed getting to see the behind the scenes of pro football with Evan's character and to see pro football from both Evan's perspective as a player and Jette's perspective as his girlfriend.This wouldn't be a Suzanne Sweeney novel if there wasn't some mystery and scary drama involved! While I won't give away any of the details I'll say this...Suzanne knows how to put her readers on the edge of their seats and how to keep up the suspense so that the reader can't put the book down!I read this book in one sitting...which means I was up all night and very sleepy the next day! While things are going really well near the end of the book there is a major cliff hanger! UGH! But this is one of the few series that I don't mind waiting for the last book to come out...as long as it doesn't take too long until the release of the final book!

When he plays, he plays to win. Rook is the only one he didn&#8217;t win.Just when I thought I was a smart ass and had channeled some of Ford&#8217;s genius and worked something out......BAM!!!I got blindsided.Crikey. Didn&#8217;t see that coming.Ford is everything and more in this book.He has met his match intellectually.Enter Ashleigh.Ashleigh may come across as fragile, in need of saving and a mamma to boot, but she knows what she wants. She likes to talk things out with Ford. She likes to challenge his beliefs in himself.&#8220;But yeah, I&#8217;m not usually so nice. You caught me on a bad day.&#8221;&#8220;This is a bad day? What are you like on a good day? A saint?&#8221; This brings the smile back, at least partly.&#8220;No, on a good day I&#8217;m myself. On a good day I would&#8217;ve left you in your car all night.&#8221;She looks over at me quickly. &#8220;Would not&#8217;ve.&#8221;Ford thinks he knows what he wants. He thinks he can&#8217;t show emotion, but he is hurting from Rook.He wanted Rook. He can&#8217;t have her. He won&#8217;t settle for less.I&#8217;m not an emotional guy. I mean, I get what she&#8217;s saying, but even after my dad died, I never wanted to like, kill myself or anything. I have a strong sense of preservation. And I suppose that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t always put others first.Ashleigh likes to interrupt and question Ford.And then she does shut up and go away.I sit here thinking it over several minutes before I come to the conclusion that I have just been word-slapped by a girl who never raised her voice or used profanity.Ford likes to control.Game on.Ford likes his space.&#8220;Sphere of privacy, people. Now.&#8221;I could so see Rutherford saying that. It made me laugh. I think that is a quote that will stick with me forever. I can actually see Sheldon from Big Bang Theory saying this. Ford is after all a genius.But there is more stuff going on here than first meets the eye and I loved watching it unfold.I loved watching Ford...evolve.&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I say to Kate, my captive audience. &#8220;That&#8217;s some shit right there.&#8221;Ford is growl worthy.His sexual side is... * growl *&#8220; Tonight I promise you perfection. So just give in, Ashleigh. Give yourself to me and let it happen.&#8221;I simply love listening to Ford&#8217;s inner monologue.Where are you going, Ford?I don&#8217;t answer the voice. Partly because I have no idea and partly because it&#8217;s not good to encourage the internal monologue.I know I am odd. I do, I admit it. I understand this, I own it. What can I say. I was just born this way.This is my new thing, since I met Rook. I&#8217;m trying to make amends for any and all weird past behavior.

The conversation between both of them had me turning pages because the dialogue was written appropriately for both time periods, giving the story that extra kick it needed to really pull someone into the scenes and become connected with the characters.I also loved the humor because Emily was very proper. It gave her an edge of wittiness without coming off as too naive in a modern time (because she had time-traveled to the future.)

Never did I think this would be a premise of a book I would absolutely fall in love with, but I put my trust in Shay Savage and she delivered a beautiful life-long, love story.This story is written in Ehd's points of view, which is a good thing because he does little more then grunt (huh, not much different then today's man).  We don't hear much from the heroine because, even though she talks a lot, Ehd can't understand her (again not much different then today).  Through good writing, the reader experiences with them the struggles of their life and the pureness and simplicity of their love and companionship.  I can't help but think the setting of this book was intentional to emphasis that this is how life and love should be.  In most romance books today and in our society in general, love relationships are filled with angst, grand expectations, and great difficulties when love should be simple and pure to help support us in life's struggles.I hope others, who may be hesitant like I was because of the premise, will take a chance on this book.

I have only read one of Ann&#8217;s series (Corine Solomon series, the first book) but it was enough to know that I&#8217;ll probably like everything else she writes. You&#8217;re probably wondering if I even read the synopsis&#8230;I probably did but truthfully I don&#8217;t even remember it because when I started Bronze Gods my initial reaction was there&#8217;s faes in this book?! But I am so glad I bought this book because it exceeded my expectations yet I am kicking myself for reading it a year after I bought it. What was I thinking?The world building was done beautifully. The authors created such a vivid world, with realistic characters that you can&#8217;t help but emotionally empathize and connect with. The writing was superb, there were no detail too small to describe; from a description of a small loose button to the dark and grim atmosphere of Dorstaad. I was fully immersed into this wonderful new word that Ann and Andres created. I never once found myself questioning the make-up of the world/or its foundation. There were times I was a bit confused as to what was what because there were flashback/dreams sprinkled throughout the book (the time before the gates were closed to the faes) but I was able to make sense of things as the book progressed. And more so when the book concluded with most of my questions explained.While the world building was incredible, the best part is actually the two leads. Bronze Gods is centered around two CID: Criminal Investigation Department inspectors, Ritsuko and Mikani who are working on a murder case. Someone or something is going around murdering daughters from prominent/Ferishers houses. I was a little worried that our two lead characters would be bland and boring&#8230;the whole stereotypical idea of two detectives with the label &#8216;one is the brain, the other the brawn of the operation&#8217; is used synonymously when it comes to the Steampunk genre (most of the time, when it has the crime noir element). However, a couple of chapters in; I was assured that Mikani and Ritsuko are nothing of the sorts. Stereotypical that is. Both characters have so much depth, with rich history/background that made them come alive on paper. I like that they weren&#8217;t perfect either. Ritsuko is clever, organized, always poised while Mikani is the complete opposite. It was interesting to see two completely different type of people counterbalance one another perfectly. I love how the two worked together, their friendship and overall admiration for one another. They always had each other&#8217;s back no matter the situation; they were even willing to die for each other. It went beyond just partners, it was more&#8230;It was sweet. As you can guess, their work/friendship-relationship evolves over the course of the book into something more, a slow burning sexual tension between the two. Both Ritsuko and Mikani feel something but are too scared to risk the special bond they already have. I mean something is definitely there, they feel it and the readers feel it&#8230;it just a matter of if or when will they act on these new feelings. Ritsuko and Mikani&#8217;s work/friendship-relationship had me thinking of Hank and Charlie (Charlie Madigan series by Kelly Gay, an awesome UF series I love). I LOVE Hank and Charlie, they are one of my all-time favorite lead couple/duo and Ritsuko and Mikani are very reminiscent of them&#8230;so it comes as no surprise that Ritsuko and Mikani just landed a spot on my favorites list. They are definitely characters readers will fall in love with and will root for&#8230;I already am.Overall Bronze Gods was an excellent debut by wife and husband team, Ann and Andres Aguirre. It is everything a Steampunk should be; excellent world building, characters, and mystery plot and a dash of romance. The ending wrapped up nicely answering questions to the current problem (for the most part) but also leaves an opening for the next book, SILVER MIRRORS which comes out next month! I am super excited and can&#8217;t wait to see what happens next with Mikani and Ritsuko! I loved this book way more than I expected, and would highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys Steampunk, PNR and UF&#8230;not a series to be missed.

William Von Becker of Ponzi scheme fame is now a suicide in federal prison. New York City crime and Wall Street high finance mix in this thriller. A fun weekend read.For those who have not read the first Jason Stafford:BLACK FRIDAYS (2012): Jason Stafford is a former Wall Street hotshot who made some bad moves, paid the price with two years in prison, and is now trying to put his life back together. He&#8217;s unemployable, until an investment firm asks him to look into possible problems left by a junior trader who died recently in an accident. What he discovers is big &#8211; there are problems, all right, the kind that get you killed.  But it&#8217;s not his only concern. Stafford has another quest as well: to reclaim his five-year-old son, &#8220;the Kid,&#8221; from his unstable ex-wife, and then learn just what it means to make a life with him. The things Stafford discovers about himself in the process are every bit as gripping as his investigation, and when the two threads of his life come together &#8211; the results are unforgettable.My review: GOOD STRONG STORYTELLER very entertaining, The Characters have depth. It's all about balancing - Wall Street, North and South, self versus world, crime versus honesty. The story opens with a harrowing death. Next we see 44 year old Jason Stafford being released from Federal prison after serving two years. He had been a millionaire Managing Director of a NY investment bank until his creative accounting, false filings and trade malpractice with billions of dollars was exposed. His only remorse is that now his MBA is no good and he missed his son. Prior to being convicted, he and his wife had worked out how to keep half his money by &#34;divorcing&#34; and setting up a trust for their son. Sad to say he got what was coming to him again as his gorgeous self-centered, Cajun from Louisiana, ex-wife Angie has deserted him and their son while she shacks up with guy who doesn't mind who he throws a few punches at. His 5 year old severely autistic son Jason Jr, called affectionately &#34;the Kid&#34; by his dad, is parked with his mother-in-law not getting any professional treatment for the last 2 years which is critical at that age (the mother should be jailed for abuse). Jason breaks parole, flies to Louisiana to retrieve his son & finds he is confined to his room 24x7. They return to his apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where Jason is completely overcome by the attention his son needs. He takes action and find a schooling for his son but that costs money he doesn't have.  He gets a lucky break in a call from the CFO of a Wall Street Investment firm offering a job for two weeks. They are heading into a huge merger, The Securities & Exchange Commission is going to be looking at everything. They want some assurance that nothing will be found, and if so they want Jason to find it first so they can do damage control and who better then a thief to find thievery? One of their traders died on a boating trip and Jason is tasked to deep dive his files. His research makes what he did time for look junior league and the mayhem commences and the FBI now want Jason to go undercover! If that's not enough Jason starts making up for time lost in the pen with new girlfriend Wanda. My 74 year old dad and I both read it and he had no problem following all the financial terminology.

She wanted him so badly, and she could feel her nipples harden not just from the sudden temperature change, but also because she wanted this man as well.&#34; - See what I mean??The first 40% of the book is Tara arriving in Alaska. We find some background info about her and it's good info.Then she meets Uriah and the next 12% is a tour of the house. (52% total)Next 6% is dinner. (58%)Next 8% - five days have passed?? (66%) We don't get to see any interaction between the two and yet...At 81% into the book she is in his bed.I would give the following stars...5 stars because the description sounds like a book I would love to read thus the reason I downloaded it4 stars because I am SO glad that I got it while it was free.3 stars because the idea behind the book is good...but it needs help so that the reading is smooth.2 stars because there was not much background on him, his home (which sounds grand), and not much romance between the two lovers.1 star because I finally gave up on correcting it in my head just so I could understand what the author was saying.I am giving it a 3...because I can see the potential in this book but it fell flat of reaching the goal of being a truly entertaining book that would allow the readers to escape their personal reality. (At least that's the main reason why I read books!)I wish Ms. Caspian good luck with her new editor.

Not for anything in particular, just a soul-hunger. A longing. Something is needed beyond what television is going to give. Something about God, or about the meaning of your life, or about eternity.&#34;&#34;A Godward Heart&#34; is a devotional collection by John Piper.  John Piper is a well-known author, preacher, and teacher. He is well-known for his book, &#34;Desiring God&#34;. Piper spurs on to encourage, challenge, give insight, and bring us nearer to  God through his writings in &#34;A Godward Heart&#34;.Are we longing for something more? If so, this is our chance. To pursue our deeper longing. Something that a blaring television can never satisfy. A longing that draws us nearer to the Lord, and sends us on a quest to go deeper in our walk with Christ!One of things I deeply appreciate is his note to the readers. There is where I found these words: &#34;I have written. And you are reading. And God is ready to act. My words are not Scripture. They are not infallible like God's words. But my earnest aim in all I write is to be faithful to God's written Word in the Bible. To point to God and his Son and his works and his ways.&#34;In this book, Piper offers meditations for our journey. Oh, how our journey would be greatly changed and challenged, as we read and meditate on the things within the contents of this book.Each devotional is relatively short. They are thought-provoking devotionals that help us to go deeper into Scripture. It is devotionals that will encourage, inspire, give you insight, and finally and most importantly give you something to meditate upon. Not only meditate, but being drawn nearer to the Lord as you seek Him and answer to the longing God has placed in your life- a longing that only He can fill.I was given a free copy of this book, in exchange for a honest review by Waterbrook Multnomah", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Thought Provoking", "unixReviewTime": 1393200000, "reviewTime": "02 24, 2014"}

This book was a sweet and enduring tale of how two people worked to move on from the secrets of their past so that they could have a better future.Nellie Forester is a beautiful alternative roller derby girl. She likes to put out a tough front but on the inside she really just wants that sweet and lasting kind of love. The hard part is that her rainbow hair, tattoos and piercing can make it hard to get close to people. Nellie grew up with the perfect life always doing what made everyone else happy. That is until she got hurt so bad that she decided that making everyone else happy was making her just the opposite. She decided to ditch the clean cut look that was forced upon her and let her true self shine.Owen Black is tall, dark, handsome and tatted. After being betrayed by the only girl he ever loved he made choices he cannot take back and feels guilt he cannot get over. He has closed himself off from love. After watching how his bad decisions affected everyone around him he decides to get his life on the right track.Owen meets Nellie in class and is taken aback by the blur haired beauty. He knows from the first moment that this girl is different and that she is meant for him. But can the two of them get over the betrayals of their past relationships in order to have a future together?For me, this book was a sweet Young Adult that is relatively low (as far as typical New Adult goes) drama. I do wish the more intense drama at the end of the book had started a bit sooner. But, that being said I did really enjoy the book and still had a hard time putting it down while I was reading it.

One thing he remembers is a young girl trying to comfort him when he was hurt.  Believing she was a figment of his imagination, he goes through the motions of his life.  He is a man whore that never gets with a women twice but he did even say that if he meet the girl he thinks he imagined then he would move hell and earth to be with her.

Again, to give much more of a summary not only risks spoiling the story, but also wouldn&#8217;t come close to doing it justice.The cast of characters continues to expand as we get to meet more of Ram&#8217;s family as the wedding approaches and we learn of Litha, her upbringing and heritage.  The adventures continue as we are introduced to Abraxas Demons and werewolves, not to mention the continued fight with vampire.  The wedding itself is a tremendous undertaking with many hilarious, sexy and enlightening scenes throughout.  Watching Litha singlehandedly bring Storm back from the heartbreak of losing Elora, however, is a wonderful gift full of humor, determination, love and devotion that was a privilege to read.Once again, Victoria Danann has crafted an elegant story with nuggets of incredible humor and intense sensuality waiting to be discovered by the reader.

Eventually, the similarity of the crimes leads investigators, Felicia Stone form Richmond and Odd Singsaker from Trondheim, to work together to solve the mystery. The case in complicated by a rare book from the 1500s apparently covered in human skin that might have belonger to the first serial killer.The novel is dark with graphic descriptions of the murder victims. That coupled with the description of the mendicant monk in the 1500s who wrote the rare book makes for a very eerie setting. Although the moving between countries and centuries is interesting, it does make for a rather disjointed presentation in the early chapters. When the detectives begin to work together, the narrative follows a more straightforward course.The plot contains many clues as well as red herrings. If you like to try to solve the mystery along with the detectives, you have plenty of information to work with.The novel contains a great many characters. In the early part of the book we get detailed thoughts from many of them. I thought the author spent too much time giving us the thoughts of minor characters thus distracting from the plot, but it did give a more rounded picture of the people involved in the story.The writing seems stilted at times, but it's difficult to know whether this is the translation, or the author. Once you get into the story it's not bothersome, but it is a little off putting in the beginning.If you enjoy a dark mystery, a serial killer, and graphic descriptions, this is a book you'll enjoy.I reviewed this book for Net Galley.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "An Eerie Scandinavian Mystery", "unixReviewTime": 1392076800, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2014"}

This book is just as the title says... it was CRAZY GOOD y'all. I loved this story. I strayed up all night reading because once I started, I could not stop. It was sweet, sexy, HOT, sad, heartbreaking, and full of angst. This book will tear at your emotions in such a deep way. It is not only a love story but it is also about second, third and fourth chances. It is about living life and taking chances. It is about going above and beyond for the ones you love. It is about being true to yourself and knowing you are worth it.I loved the hero Maverick. He is a Navy SEAL (I mean who doesn't love a military man). He is a total man ho when we meet him. He uses women for the one thing he thinks he can get from them and moves on quicker than you can blink your eyes. When he meets our heroine, he is literally knocked on his butt by his feelings. Maverick has such a good heart though. I will say that Maverick dues have a dark secret that could year then apart. His times in war were sad and dark. There is no other way to describe them. It makes you appreciate it military men and women that much more.Now on to the heroine Windsor. I loved Windsor. She was smart, funny, but a risk non rush taker. She lives for numbers and didn't like change or taking risks. She was always scared of risks and how it could jumble up her life. When she meets Maverick, sparks fly. She denies she wants him. She totally turns him down. But a girl can only hold out for so long and when these two came together, it was beautiful.Now on to the hard parts of this story. The prologue is a total mind eff. I mean seriously! Chapter One then backs up a year and a half and shows us how they get to that point. Their romance is different. They are each holding back for their own reasons. They are both afraid to let each other in because of past awful relationships. They both have seriously effed up families so a HEA seems impossible but when you take risks and live for the moment, anything is possible. There is also an incident that happens toward 3/4 of the way in the book that had me sobbing and going through the emotions with the characters. Oh gosh. It was sad. I won't give away any spoilers but have tissues ready for several scenes in this book.I also loved the secondary characters. I loved Gretchen. The scene where she is dressed in lingerie and holding a riding crop- classic! I also loved Morganna. She was fierce, determined, and so freaking loyal even when she didn't have to be. I loved Stone. He was Maverick's voice of reason. I really didn't care for Steve but to reach his own. He spelled TROUBLE! I hated Nash in the beginning and he grew on me by the end even if he is the ex.This is my first book by this author and it surely won't be my last!!

Mind spiraling, constantly strategizing in the outside world for how I could get my needs met, never succeeding, because underneath all my strategies was insecurity, confusion as to what those needs even were, etc. I was clinging, emotionally grasping, unknowingly turning off the very people from whom I was seeking comfort and stability.I was in so much pain that I was willing to sit down and put the time in and do what is suggested in the book.And my whole world changed. It's too long of a process to describe here, but I learned how to FEEL what was going on, and therefore move the pain through and out of my body, all the while in the very process of doing that sending myself and my past pain the love that it was so seeking from outside myself.Don't get me wrong, I've long since gotten over the whole &#34;loving ourselves is enough&#34; mentality of the bohemian and feminist movement that I was very much a part of. We are human, we were meant for closeness and intimacy. So I don't think the goal is to just learn how to &#34;go it&#34; alone how I always thought we should be able to before. But this book helped me love myself so utterly and deeply that I knew how to take care of myself through my hurts so that I could then communicate authentically, not manipulatively. I was able to state what I needed and how I needed to care for myself. No more grasping. No more desperation. Unless, of course, you're talking about the desperation I felt to continue to connect on a daily basis with what I discovered to be the most beautiful, soft, radiant, warm, loving part of myself. Doing these practices became my favorite part of every day. I became addicted to loving and discovering myself!!! :-)  That then started drawing people TOWARDS me, because for the first time I was connected to it myself.Some people have said some of the exercises are hokey, and the term &#34;inner child&#34; turns some people off. Please, don't throw out the baby with the bathwater. Our inner child is just the FEELING, emotional and receptive part of ourselves. Not our intellectual, thinking, heady part that always uses strategizing in the outer world as a solution, often completely missing the mark in its best attempt to meet our needs, because we've never even learned how to tune into what we're REALLY wanting and needing. This book teaches you how to do it.My only complaint is the book title. It just doesn't really suffice for what the book is about. To me, it makes it sound like it's only for people who don't  have community and friends and feel alone. No, it's about connecting with the part of you that is so wholly beautiful, tender, and loving inside, and radiating that outward naturally so that you are in a state of constant feeling of Oneness and connection.

A. area diner to find a hottie who thinks the world will open for her with her husband dead.  Complications ensue.The writing is simple and straightforward, in the first person past, very colloquial (for the early 1930s).  The story is simple and straightforward, but there is a lot of space for the reader to explore.  There is an awful lot going on between Frank and Cora that goes unsaid, and it's up to you to figure out which way it might go, before it very quickly does.  It's two shallow, selfish, impulsive and not-that-bright people coming up with plans that fit themselves perfectly, and it doesn't go well.Frank is a fast mover, itinerant and restless, and Cora has dreams and designs of success and contentment unburdened by thoughts of preparation or achievement.  Both are after something better, although neither knows what that might look like.  Their collision is hot stuff, right from the eighth page.  The novel was tried for obscenity in Boston but that was more than 80 years ago, and by today's standards this is all relatively tame, prime-time content, both the sex and the violence (there are some fun, saucy plays on the word \"hard\").

Mix sex, money and murder and trust goes out the window.And do I detect a cynical commentary on the dubious promise of the American dream?

A name created for him by the publisher of New York Magazine so as to keep his weekly Wall Street columns anonymous.Rarely have the need to quote from a book been greater, and a good way to start is with Paul Samuelson's front-cover phrase \"a modern classic\", as it embraces the book beautifully. On one hand the book is eons ahead of its time, crafting the mindset-house that practitioners like Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch and the behavioural finance entourage would furnish. But on the other hand it has a clear scent of the past. Every book is in some way a reflection of its time. The principles and aura of Benjamin Graham's Security Analysis (published 1936) would for example likely have been vastly different without the experiences of The Great Depression and so would The Money Game, first written in 1967. The ebullient 1960s are ever present in the book's dense 250 pages.Which brings us back to what The Money Game is about - image, reality, identity, anxiety and money in that order. \"If you don't know who you are, this is an expensive place to find out. That has to do with people who want to lose\". But do not be mistaken, despite the personal writing style (later described as that of \"a witty urban dinner guest\") the book is full of substance, just very elegantly served. It is a clear heir to the Jesse Livermore crowd - people who view the markets as a top-down organism. But it has also proved to be a treasure trove for Grahamites in pointing out the opportunities that abound for people with a bottom-up mentality. Value and The Game must and will co-exist and jointly move about in a Yin-Yang relationship.Re-reading the book cover, to cover the brilliance of the chapter What Are They In It For? strikes me again. \"Ninety percent of the people in the market don't care about making money\". The term \"people\" might also have been exchanged from meaning individuals investing own money to civil servants within mutual fund houses. But the importance of being part of what's going on, being there and knowing things, supersedes the making money part, at least correctly defined.One is reminded of Lord John Maynard Keynes: \"The Game of professional investing is intolerably boring and overexacting to anyone who is entirely exempt from the gambling instinct; whilst he who has it must pay to this propensity the appropriate toll\". The size of the appropriate toll via lower returns on high friction-cost trading and being sucked into what's hot at the moment are at the same time detrimental to the overall return of the pool of savings, yet opportunity for the value investing community. But the irony is that money is the way we keep score in this game, but \"for the true players you could take all the trophies away...as long as there is a way to keep score they will play\".The simple brilliance of the author's Irregular Rules (the name itself breathes genius) speaks for itself. But allowing myself to single one out, it has to be Rule#2: \"The identity of the investor and that of the investing action must be separate\". As displayed by the different Rules, part of the quality of the book is the author's impeccable ability to dance to the right as well as to the left; his bias is hard to detect, leaving the reader with the task of being subjective. On a closing note, being so ahead of its time, what did Adam Smith have to say about high frequency trading, topic of the day via his modern-day heir Michael Lewis? Worry not, he devoted an entire chapter to this: \"-Irwin, tell the truth now, if all these computers go on the air, as you say, does individual investors stand any chance? -Well, there is always luck.\"This is a review by investingbythebooks.com", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The original", "unixReviewTime": 1398470400, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2014"}

Almost everything is tied-up neatly with a shiny bow.However, my major critique of this novel is all the filler and unnecessary POVs that do not push the plot forward; rather, I'm assuming they serve as a commercial for Clare's upcoming series taking place in the same world.  I almost guarantee you that, like me, you will be reading quickly past the \"Maia\" and \"Emma\" POVs because you never really cared about them to begin with since they were never established as important characters from the start, and because their integration into the main plot have been disruptive at best.  If you do not read their parts the story does not suffer, which further emphasizes the uselessness of their POVs.In general, though, I would still recommend this book if you've been with Clary and Jace since the beginning.  As mentioned earlier, the conclusion is satisfactory, if a bit treacly (nothing wrong with that!).  Plot-wise I think you could see some of the conclusions coming a mile away, which makes the story anti-climatic at times (especially the final battle).  Also, some of the actions and decisions made by the adult Clave members borderline on being a bit too idiotic and irresponsible to be believable.  Oh, and remember how everyone complains that the ending to \"The Return of the King\" in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is too long?

Cue some five-hundred pages of Alex traveling across the country to question various people.&#34;The Murder Artist&#34; started okay, but eventually became a complete chore to finish. The first half goes through all the elements involved in tracking and solving a kidnapping case. Local police, FBI agents, private investigators, media assistance....it all seems accurate, but it's not terribly thrilling. When Alex strikes out on his own, you would think that would kickstart the tension and suspense. But....no. The second half of the novel is Alex chasing various leads and questioning a never-ending supply of people. He will meet up with one person who gives him some information, at which point that person will direct him to another person for him to get some further facts from. It's just endless. And he doesn't even seem like a particularly good investigative journalist. At one point he has a magician right in front of him mentioning a &#34;rope trick&#34;, and never actually follows this up. Instead, he ends the interview and starts visiting bookstores to learn more. Huh?There's just a long line of delaying tactics employed to drag out the word count. The worst offender is the voodoo ritual Alex participates in to apparently learn some more information about the kidnapper. Only to not learn much at all, and advised to question yet more people. And if the detective on the case has all these ideas about what leads Alex should follow and who he should question - WHY ISN'T THE DETECTIVE DOING THIS HIMSELF?Perhaps the most grating element of all is the fact that this had the potential to be really creepy and exciting. A magician who has gone off the rails to employ murder as part of his act? Sounds great! There are also brief shining moments when the killer taunts Alex by leaving clues, or leading him on a creepy goose-chase through a cemetery. But it doesn't add up to much. The author is too busy having Alex question people to pay any attention to other elements, such as....WHY THE KIDNAPPER IS DOING THIS? I would have appreciated some more insight into the kidnapper's mindset.Also got annoyed at the portrayal of the twins' mother. She gives up hope very quickly, hassles Alex about spousal support payments, and is not heard from again. Didn't ring true for a second, and the &#34;uncaring mother&#34; is a cliche I would like to see less of in kidnapping-themed thrillers (particularly considering a woman is one of the co-writers).I forced myself to finish this.

Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Firefly, Farscape are all coveted favorites of mine, and I have always been into science fiction books. When I saw Avalon pop up for review a while back, I couldn't resist snagging it. Not to mention the blurb mentioned Firefly- which is a smart marketing move on their behalf since I will insta pick up if it is reminiscent of my beloved short-lived show.I enjoyed Avalon myself. I can definitely see where they would relate it to Firefly, but for young adults. A rag-tag band of mercenaries working for a crime lord while avoiding the ITA (which is basically the government that controls space)? Yep- definitely reminiscent of Firefly. I really liked the premise of this novel and it managed to hold my interest, despite a few lulls in the storyline. I also enjoyed the characters, even though we really only get to know them at face value. I wouldn't say there was a lot of depth or development where they were concerned.I liked Jeth as our protagonist. He is the leader of the group and loves a bit of adventure. However, he is protective of his crew, especially his younger sister Lizzie. After losing their parents, the responsibility has really fallen to him, as their uncle Milton hasn't really proved himself to be of much use. Having lost the Avalon to Hammer Dafoe, crime lord extraordinaire and Jeth's boss, Jeth is determined to do enough jobs to buy her back and then try to start a new life elsewhere with his sister. However, what Jeth doesn't realize until later, is that walking away from Hammer isn't going to prove as easy as he thinks. This definitely made me think of Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt! :D Substitute carbonite for an implant that controls your brain and you've got a big problem!I also really liked Lizzie. She's young, but she's extremely tech-savvy and a good addition to the crew. Jeth is very protective of her and while he isn't overly emotional towards her, you can tell he still cares.Jeth certainly never imagined that he and his crew would be swept up into a storm between the ITA and Hammer, as both want the same valuable information a lost ship in the Belgrave Quadrant has in its possession. Traveling to the Belgrave Quadrant is extremely dangerous and has been deemed off limits by the ITA. Ships and people get lost in the Belgrave, never to be seen again. Taking this job is a gamble, but with his freedom and his ship dangling in front of him, it's a risk Jeth is willing to take in order to leave his life of crime behind.This book definitely has its share of twists and turns and there was one that really made me angry! It started a negative chain reaction and really made Jeth's life a mess. I felt complete despair for him and I was really unhappy that this character committed such an act of betrayal. I can understand why they would do it, but upon making such assumptions and not COMMUNICATING really landed not only Jeth, but themselves in a world of trouble.I am looking forward to book two, Meridian, as Avalon not only has loose ends to expand upon, but introduced some new twists and turns that will need exploring! My biggest qualm with this one was that while engaged in the overall story, there were points where I was pretty bored and ready to move forward. If you are a science fiction fan, I would give this one a try.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Enjoyed the premise of this novel and it held my interest despite a few lulls in the storyline", "unixReviewTime": 1390780800, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2014"}

I have never read this author but this book kept coming up as a recommended read and first loves are one of my favorite stories. So, I put this on my tbr list and didn't purchase it until I knew the 2nd book - Complete - was out. That's my new strategy now...fyi.Seriously, this is one of the best stories about 'first loves' that I have read. There are plenty of really detailed reveiws here so I won't go into the whole synopsis of the book but just share why I thought it is an amazing story.First, both Grayson and Lily are just great characters that feel so real. Grayson's home life is less than ideal since his mother is an alcoholic and he finds out that he was an 'accident' so he is a brooder and his personal self-worth is damaged. He is a passionate soul. Lily is just the opposite...she is sunshine and light but very sincere, to the point and intense as well. I also really liked the side characters, Aidan, Mia, Bethany, Ben...all good additions to the story.Second, the POV is from Grayson and it is so well done. You can see, understand, and again, feel everything. It was a very emotional read! I am a reader who needs 'angst' to make a romance a 5 star but it can't be superficial and this one sure does have it. It's a rollercoaster ride of emotions. You will be happy, mad, want to yell....sometimes at both Grayson and Lily. Great writing.Third, this is a pretty clean read! There are not detailed sex scenes or even lots of strong language. I think sometimes authors use strong language and sex scenes to bring the angst but not in this book and that was really surprising. In fact, I really didn't even realize how little detail there was to the sexy scenes until I was done and really thought about it!  Very refreshing indeed.I purchased this book as well as Complete for .99c each...omg, what an amazing deal. Both are worth so much more. These are books I will enjoy revisiting for sure. So, download this one and Complete as well because you will want to continue reading the story as soon as you finish this book. And...it will be well worth it!

All worries fall away, just being with him as he enjoys the simple little pleasures life has to offer. Food: \"For almost a year, I'd been devouring Milka chocolate bars... We'd bought enough for an army, and I considered it my personal challenge to devour one ever night.\" Dogs: \"Max thumped his tail on the grass and nuzzled me with a wet nose... I stroked his ears and rested back on my elbows on the warm grass.\" Family: \"There was something about those sweet little faces, their soft hands and kisses, their incessant noise and joyful shrieks that made me feel whole and alive.\"Yet, at a moments notice Gus snaps out of his relaxed mood, and the mood alternates from soothing to suspenseful when an emergency presents itself. Here is is, leaping to rescue Lily, a Korean woman trapped in a burning house: \"The black cloud rolled with a vengeance now, completely clouding my vision. I struggled to breathe and reached for the stairway rail, trying to balance.\" Or on another call to action, \"With vengeance and absolutely no remorse, I swung again, this time at the back of his head. I put all I had into the blow.\" These changes in mood drive us through the twists and turns of the story, trusting all the while that all will end on an upswing note, and we will find ourselves with Gus at a cozy place in the end.Note the respect and warm-hearted affection with which Gus describes Kip Sterling, the elderly Alzheimer's stricken man known as `the music man', whom he meets in a local nursing home : \"Deep character lines etched his face, offset by dark blue eyes that drifted to days forgotten.\" Looking at Kip, Gus is touched by the mystery of a mind disappearing. Could Bella, Kip's first and only love, still be alive? Would he, Gus, find her and bring her before Kip in time? Will the old man have the opportunity to say to her, \"My Bella. Oh my God.

I have had a run of heroines who are either weak, inanely stubborn and obstinate, or just downright irritating. Any heroine who does parkour across the rooftops of  buildings in central London has my respect and admiration! On top of that her yahoo email is CatO9tails. Winning!Now we can't have a lackluster alpha to pair with our fabulous heroine can we? Heck, no and Hunter doesn't disappoint with our hero either. Andy McTavish is Irish, cheeky, self assured, darkly handsome, and determined. Well, let the fire works commence. With the email handle of Dark Rider he elicits all types of fantasy worthy scenarios that Hunter delivers on throughout this engrossing book.There's a little something for everyone in this book. Action, intrigue, romance, steaminess, and humor are all delivered in this addition of the Pleasures series. I have not read the first 3 books, but I will now have to go back and get them. Roz and Andy have a history that I missed by reading this one as a stand alone and I am now intrigued by the stories of the characters that came before this addition to the series. This was an enjoyable read and can be read as a stand alone, but I would suggest you start from the beginning and enjoy the ride up to The Pleasure of Spring.You can find me at Monlatable Book Reviews", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Enjoyable read", "unixReviewTime": 1400544000, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2014"}

Children die by the dozen...and the count keeps growing.&#34;Child 44,&#34; set in Russia near the end of the Stalinist era, shows just how ludicrous a system of government was imposed on the Russian people during that period.  Since Stalin and his followers insisted that their governmental system was perfect, no one could afford to admit that crime took place inside the country's borders.  Everyone was said to have everything they needed to live a good life, jobs were supposedly plentiful, and the government took such good care of the citizens of Russia, that there was simply no reason for crime to exist...so it didn't.  And anyone who dared say otherwise, risked being declared insane or an enemy of the state.  Either way, they were probably never going to be seen again.MGB (the State Security Force) officer, Leo Demidov, was not about to rock the boat even when he suspected that he might be arresting an innocent person or, even worse, destroying a man's whole family in the process of making that arrest.  He believed that &#34;the means justified the ends,&#34; and that his job was to protect his country from those within it that wanted to destroy it by overthrowing its government.  If a few innocents were caught in his net, that could not be helped.  He had to protect Mother Russia.But, when the system turns on Leo and his own family, his eyes are awakened to his past sins.  Now, all he wants to do is live long enough to destroy the man who has been allowed to kill so many of Russia's children.Tom Rob Smith has written a real page-turner here and this one should greatly appeal to fans of crime fiction, thriller fiction, and historical fiction.

She is following broadcasts of safe havens where survivors gather and there is safety in numbers, as she heads north towards Canada, and hopefully safety.I really loved this book. It was great to have a different kind of monster instead of the traditional zombie, though this story has everything good that you'd expect to find in a zombie tale. Every time Elise stops for gas, medicine, food, change of car, or sleep, she risks being attacked by the beasties. She also has to look after the needs of two very young girls which adds a different element to the story. We see Elise as a fighter when she is attacked, and a mother trying to look after her girls in a world gone mad. I mean, what other book do you have a woman trying to drive as much as she can in daylight with one daughter not toilet trained and the other with the weakest bladder in America? I loved touches like that!The beasties are brilliant and scary. They might not infect you like zombies but their claws and teeth will rip you to pieces. The beastie attacks really are tension filled as you hope that everyone will survive, and for the first half of the book the beastie attacks come thick and fast. Hotels, gas stations and shopping malls with dark corners all become danger zones even in the relative safety of daylight so every time they stop the car, I was on edge wondering what was going to happen. But I also liked the fact that the beasties begin to adapt to sunlight, grow smarter and start operating in groups. As the book progresses this enemy becomes more dangerous, more chilling, so the author is continually taking the plot forward and evolving her bad guys. That is the mark of great writing. Keep your readers guessing!The second half of the book switches to life in the safe zone which gave the book an intriguing turn. Thankfully the people in the complex were all good characters and we now see a new side of Elise as she has to let her girls have space, deal with her feelings for Jason and become a scientist again.I'm not generally a fan of people having relationships during an apocalypse based on my own opinion that I'd have enough to deal with without worrying about men! However, I did like the relationship between Elise and Jason. It evolves slowly, based on shared danger but it is complex and never perfect, giving it more realism. I liked the way the girls characters developed through the book with both having to grow up damn quick is such hostile surroundings but there were a lot of really sweet 'family' moments in there to balance the danger and horror. I also liked other characters like Benson and the scary chef! Meg was an interesting twist. I'll say no more about that!Niggles? Just one. The few science bits flew right over my head! I got the general plan-engineer a virus that will eradicate the inhuman bits of the beasties which will turn them 'human' or kill them. But when Elise starts explaining HOW the virus is made and works, my eyes began to glaze over. Phrases like vector behavior, oxygen bonded nanotechs, il vivo principle, pulsed field gel electrophoresis, Percoli gradient and isolating chromosomes were too much for me to take in and I didn't understand a word of it. For those like me who don't get science, do what I did-don't try to understand, just remember that the virus is to turn them human or kill them! That will keep you right! Seriously, not getting the science did not in any way spoil the book as you'll see from my star rating, so don't be put off by those bits if you don't get it as there isn't much of it to read.I found out about this book when I was looking at the blog of another author and took a chance on buying the paperback. I'm really glad that I did and I'll be passing it on to my dad to read. I'm sure he'll love it too!

I like it best when imagination and history intersect. This new author has done a superb job of telling the story of immigration to Canada by Russian Jews in the late 1880's. It actually followed a wealthy family and a poor Russian immigrant family and described life as it was experienced for both. My heart felt their story of fear mixed with hope. The story included the good, the bad and the ugly parts of history. My only disappointment was that I wish I knew before I read it how much historical research had gone into this.

Ruthie Knox has graciously provided me with a copy, though I would&#8217;ve (and will probably still do it) purchase a copy. See, the whole thing was compiled for charity and all proceeds go to RAINN. How awesome are these authors?Redemption by Ruthie KnoxYup. It&#8217;s exactly as Ruthie describes it in her synopsis. It&#8217;s sad and not very optimistic, and packed with (seemingly) emotionless dialogue. But if you know Ruthie Knox, you know her characters are very carefully written and the one thing that&#8217;s never neglected in her words is emotion. Jessie and Mike are full of feelings, but they&#8217;re so scared of those feelings- they act numb.What I found fascinating in this story is that Knox makes things wonderful with actions and not many words. And the end of this short story proves to be a melancholy but optimistic delight.***The Heart of It by Molly O&#8217;KeefeSometimes you stumble upon a little story that hits that spot in your heart like a curve ball to the kishka. The Heart of It is so that. There&#8217;s a troubling and burning subject this story is dealing with, the aftermath of an abuse. And then there&#8217;s a &#8211; sadly &#8211; everyday life predicament many people are facing. But the trick is to weave these two situations together and come to a resolution that turns the future to a happy possibility. And Molly O&#8217;Keefe achieved that.***Sacrifice by Cecilia TanI enjoy a fantasy story like the next gal, but I&#8217;m not sure what to think of this one in particular. I enjoyed the writing very much, and the concept of this was lovely. I think something a little more developed would&#8217;ve worked better with this plot bunny.***Real Feelings by Charlotte SteinCharlotte Stein has a way of touching my soul with the simplest words describing the most unique situations. Developing feelings for an android is not something you encounter much when reading, but damn it if I didn&#8217;t start feeling a wee bit heartchlenchingly sweet on Michael, myself.***Rainy Season by Mary Ann RiversMary Ann Rivers killed me. And she only needed a bowl to do it. I can&#8217;t say much more about this short story because every extra word will be redundant.***The Rain in Spain by Amy Jo CousinsYou never know what you&#8217;re going to get when you read an author for the first time. Amy Jo Cousins is a blissful surprise for me. Her short story deals with miscommunication of a married couple and it&#8217;s clear from the very beginning they fiercely love each other. I&#8217;m sure the romantic setting of Sevilla didn&#8217;t hurt when they worked things out in the Spanish rain.I need to find more of AJ&#8217;s words. Mission noted.***Fitting In by Audra NorthI was so excited to read this one. It was my first story of Audra North ever. And it was just lovely. The unique circumstances of Stas and Leila&#8217;s past were perfectly matched by that one extraordinary saying Stas&#8217;s father always says. And besides it being true &#8211; the emotional buildup was very sweet.***Private Study by Shari SladeSo Jameson is all kinds of awesome. A fantastic heroine who&#8217;s not afraid to try and learn new things, and makes it into science. A great hero who&#8217;s not afraid to stand up to her and gives as good as he gets. And a sweet sweet resolution. I think this was my favorite ending so far.***Storm Warning by Alexandra HaughtonHa! Never again will I think tornados are all bad. After all, this one possibly brings good friends back into each other&#8217;s lives, building sexual tension on top of fear from the storm. And what better way to deal with one tension than delve right into another, a lot more fun kind of tension? LOLVery sweet, well written story. I might like to see this one turn into a novel.***So now that I&#8217;m done reading all these short stories, I have to say this: it&#8217;s for RAINN, and whatever you consider too much for this anthology, probably isn&#8217;t.

It was discovered among the contents of a Fort Worth, Texas public storage unit sold for unpaid rent. When the buyer discovered both a handwritten and typewritten document written by Pearl Buck, she alerted the writer's family and after some negotiations, sold it to them. They have authenticated it as her work.It is probably a first or second unedited draft, but in spite of the fact that it is far from perfect and not up to Mrs. Buck's usual standard, still the family feels it is important to bring this last novel to the public. This therefore is something a reviewer must take into consideration.It is a strange tale with rather an oversimplified plot. In fact, it seemed more of a fable than a novel. The hero, Rann Colfax is remarkably and improbably clever. A genius from birth, it would seem. Learning comes so easy to him that he has mastered several languages by the time he is in secondary school. He is much too intelligent for his classmates and teachers, which leads him to wonder about the meaning of life and the part he will play in it.When his father dies while he is still young, he decides to get his education through books and travel rather than attend a university. In the process of his adventures, he becomes fabulously wealthy through two inheritances. One of them quite improbable.Throughout the novel, there is a fairy-tale quality. Rather like an Aesop's fable with a lesson that Pearl Buck wanted us to discover and take to heart. The final pages make it clear what this lesson is.As I read the opening, I wasn't sure that I would like the book at all. But as I continued, it became quite enthralling and in the end, I was left with a great deal to think about.

Confused and frustrated, Anna finds distraction in the attentions of her guardian, Lord Gantry, a man whom she respects and holds in high regard. When his growing desire for his lush young ward spills over from thoughts to actions, Anna is flattered, and readily accepts the prospect of marriage to this older man, and becoming his lady of the manor.With Anna engaged to Lord Gantry, and swept up in fittings for her wedding gown, the Civil War edges closer to Axebury Hall. Soon events are set on a collision course whereby a tragedy ensues between her young would-be suitor and older fianc&eacute;. As Royalist and Parliamentarians clash on the Axebury Estate, Anna finds there is no hiding from desire and must make a choice.By Loyalty Divided is a sensuous, evocative read. I especially liked how the author unfolds the story of the English Civil War, and the effect it had on families (who, of course have no fore knowledge of the eventual outcome). The implication of choosing one side over another, and the peril of following conscience rather than upbringing is written in such a way as to make the reader genuinely torn.

This was a very simple story of Allison wanting and loving Rhys since she was 13.  There is about a 8 year age difference between Rhys and Allison.  Because Jake is super protective of Allison, Rhys denies his feelings and does not want to pursue a relationship or anything else with Allison.  He is afraid he will hurt her, does not want Jake to be upset and is concerned about her age.  A very simple story where you can easily guess what the outcome will be.  As always in this series, I loved the alternating point of views.  Hearing from both Allison and Rhys, but without repeating the scene word for word...love it!  There is no surprise drama or action here.I loved Allison!  Yes, she was young but she totally understood what Rhys was doing and called him on all of his b.s.  She was a very strong female character who spoke her mind and went with her feelings.  I did not mind being inside her head at all.  Rhys was no where near as dominant, possessive or demanding as Jake and AJ.  Clearly, Katie Ashley knows how to distinguish her characters.  Rhys was...steady.As with each book in the series, I found it to be well written, engaging and on point.  I'll continue to follow Runaway Train!!Why Not 5 Stars?I really liked it...but did not love it, I did not think about it when I finished reading the story, I did put it down several times, I would never read it again (was not exciting enough for me).

I would have loved if it was even longer so that we could have explored the situations with Dennis and Cain a bit more. Both of those situations might have been given more depth just a little and it wouldn't have hurt the book's pacing, I don't think! I really liked the character of Dennis - these quiet, nice guy types don't get enough credit in YA books! I think I like them more than the bad boys. Leslie was definitely flawed, but you feel for her that her mom is a constant nag and she doesn't have a father figure around. Overall it was a very well-rounded cast of characters and an easy book to enjoy. No big plot device or anything like that, just the life of a teenage girl.

I did the mistake of not reading some parts because I thought it was just too much information and that was the wrong move. All that information was necessary in order to understand the complexity of the Reed brother and the company.  I happen to love a book that has love, suspense, crime, really hot sex and a hot alpha male named Jacob Reed.The characters in this story are great and I fell in love with them from the start.  Jacob is a total book boyfriend and made me swoon.  I love me a good strong alpha male character, and Jacob was that and more. He is caring, sweet and protective of Katie Wilson.  Jacob is the CEO of Reed Software and Securities Company. Jacob and his team are a covert team and work for the government for highly dangerous jobs.  Jacob has always had a thing for the beautiful Channel reporter Katie Wilson. He would always watch her news and admire the beautiful woman.  Their paths cross on a mission he and his team are on.  When things go wrong, he does not hide his strong protectiveness for Katie, regardless of how they would be against it.  Eli, Reed&#8217;s brother and the lead man on the team, is highly unlikable.  I have to say that even at the end I still got an uneasy feel with him. He seems shady, closed off and there is something VERY wrong with him.  The Special Ops team consists of Lulu, Clint, Tyler, Mason Nick, Rush and Julian, each team member brings so much to the table and you find yourself wanting to know about them.  Wait I forgot about Hauk, Reed&#8217;s dog, BEST DOG EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!Katie Wilson, what can I say, she is the woman we all want to be.  She is fearless and is not afraid to get dirty to get a story.  One night she and her cameraman, Tully, are trying to get the story that was emailed to her from an unknown source.  Things go wrong for Katie and Tully&#8230;terribly wrong.  A year later she is still trying to move on with her life after that painful night and the memories that seem scattered and shaky.  I found her to be a strong female character and I was able to relate to her.A year after their last crossing, Jacob is constantly watching Katie, without her knowledge.  When fate once again throws the two back together Jacob is determined not to let anyone and anything take Katie away again.  Jacob does not tell Katie what his real job is or how one year ago he and his team changed her life dramatically.  When danger comes crashing into Katie&#8217;s front door, Jacob will do anything to keep her safe. That includes getting his team on board even if they do not agree with his choice to not let go of Katie.When Jacob and Katie finally get together, it is so sweet, passionate and hot.  I want a Jacob, you know what I mean Alpha-Take-Charge-Kicka$$-Man.&#8220;You&#8217;re so soft.  Oh, no.  I&#8217;m taking my time with you, woman.  Next time, love.  Let me take care of you tonight.&#8221;&#8220;Please Jacob, please.&#8221;&#8220;Open those beautiful blue eyes, sweetheart.  I want to see them when I push into, as you take me inside and come for me.&#8221;Throughout the story you are trying to find out what happened at the warehouse and where the danger and threat is coming from. While praying to all Gods and Heaven that when the truth comes out Katie and Jacob are strong enough to work it out.&#8220;Somebody please explain something.  I already know Julian, but I don&#8217;t know why you are here.  And that one looks like the guy from your lobby.  We met yesterday but I need the rest of you to explain.&#8221;&#8220;Sweetheart, why don&#8217;t you sit down so I can explain a few things?  Sweetheart please let me explain.&#8221;&#8220;Okay but if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll stay right here.  I&#8217;ve had enough of being attacked this week.  Who are all you people?&#8221;&#8220;We&#8217;re part of an anti-counterterrorism team loosely associated with the government.&#8221;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I like this conversation, Jacob.  What is it that you haven&#8217;t told me?  Or still haven&#8217;t said?&#8221;&#8220;I loved you for a really long time, Katie.  Even before I met you a year ago, in March.&#8221;I was pulled into the story by trying to find out what was going on. We do not get much but I hope book 2 will bring more answers because we are still left wondering what is going on.

Hope and Laurie were best friends in college but lost touch with each other over the years.  They reconnect as Hope's fortieth birthday approaches and agree to take the Hawaiian vacation they originally planned in college.  The book chronicles their (mis)adventures in Hawaii and highlights the value of female friendships.This book is a pretty quick read, partially because I didn't want to put it down!  Overall, this is not a terribly deep book.  It's more of what I can a &#34;beach read&#34;, meaning the kind of fun, lighthearted book I would typically take on vacation with me.  Some of the plot points a little silly, and some may find it unlikely that two friends would take off to Hawaii after not speaking for twenty-something years.  However, the friendship between Hope and Laurie was really relatable to me.  I could totally picture my sister (and BFF) and I taking off to the islands, enjoying a luau and discussing the appeal of traditional Hawaii cuisine.  There are some tidbits of Hawaiian history thrown in, which I found interesting.  It also doesn't hurt that I would LOVE to walk the beaches of Hawaii.  This is a Christian book, so there are Christian elements thrown in, such as references to prayer and God but it doesn't hit you over the head.I enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys stories of friendship and a fun, light read about two women helping each other embrace the new phases of their lives.  There are nine or so books in the &#34;Sisterchicks&#34; series featuring different female characters.  Visit Robin Jones Gunn's website for more information on her books or read an excerpt here.I received this book for free from Blogging for Books.

The parents face unfair persecution by a paranoid, overzealous legal and political juggernaut headed by a haunted FBI agent determined to \"catch\" them whether they are guilty of hurting their daughter or not. Agent Zander doesn't really care about truth- he is too busy trying to resolve his neurotic issues stemming from a previous case. In the mean time, a little girl is left wandering in a treacherous forest of misery, desperately trying to survive. Most of the help that should be searching for the girl to save her is wasted trying to pin \"murder\" charges on her parents. It is a tale of every parents worst nightmare- cops willing to let a child die in order to quench their obsession with nailing the parents. It was terrifying and fascinating. Then comes the utterly ridiculous ending. The girl is found alive, the parents are exonerated, which is fine. But then the parents turn to the FBI agents who lied to them, tried to set them up for murder, left their daughter half-heartedly looked for, and psychologically tortured them, and they forgive and thank them! If I were a parent, and I was a victim of these circumstances, I would sue these agents, and agencies, until their wallets popped out of their noses!! I would not be grateful to these bumbling, keystone cops who obsessed over their assumptions of guilt, and left it to me to rescue my daughter myself. It leaves the reader with an absurd ending that doesn't match the rest of the story at all.My guess is that the author did not intend to write a dystopian thriller. I fear that the ending indicates that the author feels that his FBI agents are GOOD people- but they are not. Zander has few ethics or morals, and justifies every foul act of cruelty he perpetrates by mentally referencing a crime committed by someone else. After he sets up the mom to supposedly witness the discovery of her child's mangled corpse on live video, only to have it be a dead goat, I wanted him to pay! Instead, the mother actually forgives and thanks him.

In London any type of supernatural is executed, or they just simply disappear.Paige works in the Seven Seals for a master criminal and seems content in her role, yet her father has no idea just what Paige does as she pretends to work at an oxygen bar.I read this book a while ago and should have written my review then as this one seems difficult and now I remember why. The first 40% of this book, I needed the dictionary that was placed at the back of the paperback bookSome sentences had so many new words that I really couldn&#8217;t make it add up, so I was back and forth like a yo yo. To make matters worse I remember my head was spinning, with so much information and then it settled a bit when Paige is arrested and taken to the clairvoyant prison, which is not what all clairvoyant believed it to be. Controlled by a race of Rephaim, immortals they use clairvoyant for their gifts. On arrival Paige is assigned a keeper and he is called Warden, he is feared by most. I think straight away I could see something different in Warden, and soon we do see a mutual respect blossom between these two. But no matter how much Warden tries to protect Paige, she is always on the war path, trying to protect the ones she cares for, and trying to get home to the Seven Seals.The story was very unique, but also very confusing as in the terms that once Paige arrives at this prison a new set of rules, new words, and a new way is told to us, making you scrap everything you just learnt at the start of the book.Overall I really did enjoy this book, it was something new and refreshing.

Maya Banks hooked me from the very beginning and left me craving more at the very end.  Where have I been that this is my first ever Maya Banks read?  I know, I joined the party was late but I am happy that I finally joined because if this is what I get to read from her than I am a happy reader.Letting Go is a story of learning to let go and move forward.  A story of saying goodbye to one love and open yourself up in hopes of having another love.  For Joss that is exactly what she is forced to do after 3 years of mourning the death of her husband Carson.  Joss is determined to get her life back and be happy again.  Knowing that she will never love someone the way she loves Carson, she is okay with that.  She knows perfection can&#8217;t happen twice in a lifetime but she is tired of being lonely and sad.  She wants to feel again and smile again she doesn&#8217;t want to hurt anymore.  Always knowing that she has kept a part of herself hidden from her husband is bound and determined to explore her hidden desires.  Joss craves dominance and for the first time in her life she is ready to explore that side of her sexuality and will give it all she has.Dash Corbin has loved one girl as long as he can remember.  Always hiding his feelings because well let&#8217;s face it; it would look bad to make the moves on his best friend wife.  Every since the death of his best friend three years old he has waited for the right moment to make his move and let his feelings for Joss be known in hopes of her seeing him in a different light.  Being her strength and shoulder to cry on since the day Carson was killed he has waited until the right time, not really knowing if there was such a thing.  Dash is willing to place a part of him behind him if that means winning the love and trust of Joss.  His needs and desires that sometimes consumes him he is willing to give up for her.  He is willing to do anything, give her anything to prove that he can love her forever.When Dash and Joss come face to face in a setting that neither expect their relationship takes a sudden turn from grieving friends to something that Dash never imagined he could have.  Joss, someone who craves dominance, and Dash someone who craves submission from a woman find themselves seeing each other in a brand new light.  Can they build a dominate/submissive relationship that goes beyond just that and include love?  Or will the ghost of Joss&#8217; husband and Dash&#8217;s best friend Carson haunt them forever?Maya Banks gave me something I needed.  I was intrigued from the very beginning wanting so badly for Joss to move forward with her life and be happy and wanting to see exactly what Dash was willing to give up for Joss.  It was a beautiful story of letting go and finding new love.  There were ups and downs that left me fuming and then there were moments that made my heart swell with love for those 2 characters.  I was connected with the characters from the very start wanting so badly for them to find their happy and hopefully find it with each other.  The sweet moments were as sweet as honey and hot moments were as hot as fire and Maya left me wanting more.Letting Go is Book 1 in the Breathless Trilogy.  I need book 2 like it was yesterday &#8211; May 2014 cannot come quick enough because knowing that Book 2 is about Kylie, Carson&#8217;s sister, and Jensen, Dash&#8217;s new business partner, I can only imagine those 2 characters coming together for their own book that will most definitely be a roller coaster ride I won&#8217;t want to get off of.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "First Maya Banks Read and I am HOOKED", "unixReviewTime": 1391990400, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2014"}

Hanks is a contemporary Christian novel that speaks of God's redemption and forgiveness in marriage.Winter Cowan is a Christian speaker and the head of Passion's Prayer, a group of like-minded individuals travelling across the country sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ. Unfortunately, they are going to  Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and there is one person there she does not want to see - her ex-husband.Ty Williams is a changed man and he is determined that Winter knows it. While he realizes he was the cause of their break-up, he is trusting God to make Winter see that he is a changed man - one who believes in God now. He is determined to win her back and re-marry &#34;the wife of his youth.&#34; Now all he has to do is get Winter to forgive him. But will Winter practice what she preaches? Can she ever really trust or forgive Ty for cheating on her?And that is the crux of this story right there. Winter preaches about God's forgiveness, so now she basically has to practice it or be a hypocrite. The author has done a good job of creating the horror that Winter experienced when she was faced with the infidelity of her spouse. And she does an equally good job of showing the angst that comes with practising what all Christians preach - forgiveness.It's not so easy to forgive when you lose your trust in the one you have pledged your life to. Which is why I hope this book will touch a chord with Christians who  seem to be taking a page from the world these days and divorcing as often as Hollywood stars. It is a touchy subject, but the author has done a very good job of fleshing it out.My only problem with this book would be that everyone seems to be Christian. For example, when asking to put flyers up in a restaurant, the owner (who was Christian) encouraged Jeremy (the one putting up the flyers) to tell everyone about Jesus. And of course everyone in the restaurant was very appreciative of that. As much as I wish that would happen in real life - it wouldn't. So that seemed a bit contrived. In addition, the Pastor who moons like a puppy-dog the moment he sees Winter doesn't seem plausible either. It was in fact uncomfortable to read and made the Pastor come off as a sappy kind of teenager, which I'm sure the author did not intend. If she chose to ever rewrite her book I would suggest she work on those two areas.Despite that however, the book is one that I would encourage you to read as it speaks of love, redemption and forgiveness in a big way and I believe would be an encouragement for Christian couples who are contemplating divorce.

The book takes place in 3 cities, Manhattan (no outer boroughs in Tartt's New York), Las Vegas, and Amsterdam.  I've been in all 3 cities, and Tartt gets each of them -- Manhattan with its elegant towers and parks and multi-ethnic neighborhoods; Vegas where subdivisions fade into the desert; and Amsterdam with narrow houses, canals, and labyrinthine streets.  But the description goes on for pages and pages (I imagine, since I read it on a Kindle) with nothing happening --just endless word pictures.The book is as full of interesting characters as a Dickens novel, but one never sees inside any of the characters.  Even Theo is a bit of a cipher.  He's constantly taking drugs -- halfway through the book we learn that the pills and heroin keep his paranoia at bay.  Well,, it makes sense that a man caught in a terrorist attack would be paranoid, but how about showing and not telling?  All that verbiage, but not a word until then about Theo's fears and how the drugs keep those fears at bay.  Andy, the school friend whose family takes Theo in, has been bullied by his siblings; this we learn in retrospect -- not while its ongoing.There's a lot of action in this book, be it the drawing room drama of the Barbour family or the derring-do of various underworld figures in New York, Vegas, and Amsterdam, but all of this is rather muddy.  When the book revs up, it's so fast and furious that it's hard to tell what exactly is happening.  Boris,, Theo's Russian gangster buddy, always seems to have some kind of racket going on, and he sort of explains it, in his thickly accented English, but clearly enough for someone like me who hasn't had to deal with art thieves or international gangs.  It all has something to do with a kingpin named Sascha, and there's some guy named Horst who's a baddie with an appreciation for art, but how this all fits together is really confusing.  In fact, most of the action-packed sections of the book go by in fog and smoke.  Why is the Metropolitan Museum attacked?  What is Boris doing behind Theo's back in Vegas?  Is Theo's father just making bad bets, or does he have some other kind of racket?  And who is Lucius Reeve?  It's all kind of a hash.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Beautiful description, great characters, improbable plot, lousy pacing", "unixReviewTime": 1390003200, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2014"}

MitchellThe Storyline of the book is written from the perspective of each of the main characters, Aelena Hall and Carlin Pheney. The `Tale' opens with a very dramatic event in which Aelena is the focus. The story starts off with a BOOM, and continues on to give the reader a glimpse of a dystopian society where the United States has devolved into a United Territories. The society is divided sharply in two opposing lifestyles, the elite and privileged called WALLED-INS and the lower class struggling SERFS.Many elements have contributed to the decline of the political, economic, and moral awareness of the nation. The climate and ecological changes have caused catastrophes and reduced the agricultural production. The SERFS are given a synthetic food source which causes major health problems.The living conditions for the population of SERFS is very oppressive with little or no hope of having a better life. There are a few secret and hidden havens where the more courageous, such as Aelena, live and try to plan a revolt in order to offer a better life for the SERFS. I won't post spoilers but help does come from some unexpected characters.Carlin Pheney enters the `Tale' as the son of a major leader, but he has conflicts within himself. He will battle with the questions of right and wrong and the direction he should take as the opening event leads him to life changing choices.The `Tale' continues with scenes which are thought provoking, such as China becoming a major force in the world economy and political powers.

I will say when I first started reading I had different thoughts of what I thought this read was about but as I dove into the novel I can only say what I found was a complete surprise. Leaving me only to say in the end ... wow that was some good read of Chase and Jasmine.What I love about &#34;An Arrangement of Love&#34;This novel is one that will hold your attention and truly having you turning the pages till the end. &#34;An Arrangement of Love&#34; was a read of intrigue and so very captivating only to hold your attention because you will want to know what is coming next. Yes, you will find this read of many twist and turns giving you 'love, conflict, craziness, suspense and even murder.' How can one man hold the attention of four women was really something to read of and this author tells this story so very well bringing out all the emotions of it all. I found this hero and heroine really interesting in how she is drawn into this arrangement. Will there be benefits for Jasmine? Yes, but at what price and I love how this author kept Jasmine second guessing herself. While reading I was caught up with some laughter and even some anger with some of this weirdness, however, this still was a good read of how Jasmine really seduces this hero who had fell in love with her. Now, to get it all you must pick up &#34;An Arrangement Of Love&#34; to see how this author brings it all out because there will be some other interesting facts of Jasmine life that will come from the entire read.What I also loved about &#34;An Arrangement of Love&#34;I loved the read being of a interracial couple that was very well written of love. The characters were all so very well portrayed, well developed, colorful and even memorable. Oh, I love the hot steamy sex...it was done quite well and so lovely in the read.Now, there will be only one thing that is missing from the wonderful read and that is the ending.

That doesn't make it perfect, but it gets five stars from me.It's a big-screen story in a lot of ways, with a lot of the set-pieces, stunning plot-twists and big reveals that are so common in film and television. But the nature of novels means that the author can broadcast a mental x-ray directly from their character's heads into the reader. That means some tricks incredibly difficult to pull off in prose because they rely on keeping things secret until just the right moment. But somehow Max Barry manages to execute exactly those kind of surprising twists and turns multiple times on a number of different levels while keeping his characters feeling authentic and engaging along the way.Lexicon weaves its linguistic conspiracy back through history t0 create a plot with elements reaching back thousands of years. It's a neat trick, and when it doesn't feel forced it's almost as if you're really walking around inside the book's alternate reality rather than just being a passenger riding through a sideshow in another world.But it's the fact that this is a story about weaponized language that makes everything in Lexicon tick. It challenges us to accept that that we don't just hear words, we consume them, process them, and build (and control) our true selves through them.It posits that our &#34;self&#34; is constructed from and by our perception of language, and that it can be the source of our triumph and our downfall, both as individuals and as a species.It's a thrilling conceit, although it never gets quite meta enough for my taste. Still, most of the time it works, despite some gigantic coincidences (that could have been easily revealed as fait accompli), along with some fuzziness about the motivations of some of the characters.Those quibbles aside, Lexicon is a book that does some amazing things and tells a thrilling story at a breakneck pace. In parts it filled me with the same excitement that I feel when I'm watching a compelling television series like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones.If you'e looking for something simultaneously smart and escapist, Lexicon is a great story to spend some time with.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Power of Words", "unixReviewTime": 1404950400, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2014"}

How much of that freedom we end up actually experiencing is determined by how much we believe to be truth is the truth which is being spoken of. Paul helps us to essentially recognize freedom here as being the liberty we have in Christ Jesus, not in doing but in experiencing the quality of life God desires for us. Through an intimate relationship that is not based on a false hope of servitude but in living life as sons. Clearly our identity and value were never meant to be determined in what we do but we can humbly receive them from the only source our Father. Reading this can truly help one to experience the life that Jesus has abundantly provided but most importantly let us know that true love cannot be performance based but it is God's free and unconditional expression of Himself towards all of us.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ", "unixReviewTime": 1396483200, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2014"}

Most of us spend our time caring for what we can see (work, family, appearance, status, etc.) and neglect the inside of us because our lack of tending is easier to disguise. Our connection to God slowly fades, and one day we wake up and realize we don&#8217;t feel connected to the Vine at all anymore, and sadly we don&#8217;t really remember how the fade happened.Ortberg takes the reader on a journey to discover what the soul is, why it&#8217;s important, what it needs to be healthy, and how God restores it after a long fade.Ortberg dedicates this book to Dallas Willard, who died in 2013 from cancer. Willard had a huge impact on Ortberg&#8217;s soul development, and you can see Willard&#8217;s fingerprints all throughout this book. For me this was such a treat &#8212; Willard&#8217;s writing has been formational to me, especially during college&#8211; so to see a personal side of Willard through Ortberg brought together who I am now and a bit of my college self/ambitions/expectations of myself in an encouraging way.I think I&#8217;d like to step out on a limb and say that this may end up as Ortberg&#8217;s best book. It seems to be built on everything he has learned and written about thus far in a rich, Spirit-inspired way.I was hesitant to review this book. While I&#8217;m very interested in spiritual formation in general, I wondered if this book would be dry. Was there really that much to say about the soul? In a moment of perceived weakness, I said &#8220;yes&#8221; to the book, and I now see that it was probably the Spirit that prompted me to request it. :) This book ministered to my own soul deeply, as well as to my brain (I learned a lot!).Thank you BookLook Bloggers, for providing me with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perhaps one of his best yet", "unixReviewTime": 1404864000, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2014"}

Ultimately, I don't know enough about the topic to judge this book harshly, but I liked it for the information.  For instance I knew virtually nothing about how analysts and firms operate.  The book explains that you're likely not to see buy side analysts, as they are employed internally to investment firms, where the analysts we all see often, are sell side types, that are building up the hype on a stock, so it can be sold off.  It also goes into many illegal, and quasi-legal manipulations that have caused investors to loose billions of dollars, and why these things happened.The early part of the book is good for stocks as well, as you can do you're own investigation using the different numbers, and symbols of how a stock in performing, and how the company is being run.  Then of course there is the trading and I never knew there was so much to know about.  Spotting trends, using technology, gauging the economy are just a few of the things employed before plunking down our hard earned cash.  There is a list of do's and don't that help educate the new investor to avoid the mistakes that usually sour someone on the market.  If I had this book a few years ago I would not have lost money and ultimately left the market.  It may convince me to try again, but at a more conservative pace.

I won&#8217;t spoil it, but I have to admit it was no surprise to me.  The book takes you through the relationship of David and Claire (or maybe lack there-of).  The characters are built up well, but for any of us that have ever been in a relationship, it is frustrating.  Throughout the book it is revealed that neither of them are in the relationship for the right reasons, which may explain some of the more frustrating aspects (ok &#8211; you have to work late again for the 7th time this week!?).Ofcourse there are a few twists thrown in, nothing shocking, but makes for a good story.  All the characters and situations are realistic.  I found myself thinking of past situations or friends that reminded of me of certain characters, which made the story pass quickly but kept me interested at the same time.  It was wrapped up in a neat little bow at the end.  Would I recommend?  For a free book, with no expectations, maybe as a beach read.

Taking advantage of the situation and the fact that the majority of the male population were killed in the war, women rebuild their lives and neighborhoods. Not only that, they strip men of their power. Men aren&#8217;t allowed to take part in the government, they aren&#8217;t the heads of the households, and now they stay inside their homes and out of sight. Women&#8217;s Work by Kari Aguila is a well-written novel that will make you think long after you finish reading it.The novel is a fascinating study of the &#34;othering&#34; process and how dangerous it can be to mark a group as &#8220;not one of us.&#8221; Existing throughout history, it&#8217;s allowed some groups to wipe out others almost entirely. Aguila&#8217;s novel demonstrates how marginalizing one group can give the false sense of security when in fact it perpetuates discrimination and raises the chances of brutality. Not only that, the brutality is &#8220;justified&#8221; via this process. The mentality of &#8220;us&#8221; versus &#8220;them&#8221; doesn&#8217;t leave much room for a gray area and it slams the door shut on dialogue between two parties. Aguila doesn&#8217;t preach to the reader, but shows how this happens through her characters.The beauty of this novel is that her critique of society and what could happen is subtle. The author pulls you into the story slowly and effortlessly, careful not to overplay her hand. Right from the start, the descriptions immerse the reader into a new world.Another captivating aspect of this story is how people survive after the Last War. The author once again shows with descriptions of how her characters live. In today&#8217;s world things are easy. We flip a switch and a light turns on. Cell phones, grocery stores, cars, microwaves, and a hundred more gadgets that we may use at any given time are taken for granted. What would you do if you had to provide your own food, shelter, clothes&#8212;if you had to go back in time and take care of everything for yourself and your family? The reader is introduced to their way of life, including the hardships, the work, and scarcity. It&#8217;ll make you appreciate what you have now. Kari Aguila&#8217;s novel is beautiful and terrifying all at once. Women&#8217;s Work doesn&#8217;t pull any punches. The story starts off methodically and the tension builds with each page, with characters and a story that lingers. At times it&#8217;s impossible to put the book down.

For three years she has bounced from town to town refusing to make personal ties or allow anyone beyond her friend, Danielle, close because putting down roots is just not in the cards.  Then bookstore owner Mark Jacobson breaks through Rachel&#8217;s carefully constructed walls and shows her how pure and sweet love can be.  However, the young woman&#8217;s past is hot on her heels and will destroy them both: one for daring to run away; the other for daring to love a prized &#8220;possession.&#8221;Angie Martin published a print edition of False Security in 2004, but she chose to rework and re-release a revised version late in 2013.  It follows the complex life of twenty-six year old Rachel Thomas, a young battered woman who fled her home only to find a healthy relationship in the arms of confirmed bachelor, Mark Jacobson.  Unfortunately, Rachel&#8217;s batterer is extremely powerful and has been trying to find her ever since she escaped his control.  Before she tells Mark the truth about her past it catches up with her, threatening their lives, their sanity, and their love.Before I start dissecting False Security I must admit that while I struggled a little with the first third of the book I ripped through the latter two portions with fascination.  The insight into Rachel&#8217;s past helped me understand her somewhat erratic behavior plus I enjoyed seeing her as something beside the shutdown mouse from the first section.  The pacing kept me glued to my Kindle, and I had to forcibly turn it off to go to sleep.  However, Rachel drove me a little nuts.  I had a lot of problems believing that someone as fundamentally unhealthy mentally was an ideal person to be teaching self-defense and protection to other battered women in shelters.  I recognize that volunteers for any organization are hard to find, but Rachel&#8217;s unwillingness and inability to help herself while she was putting herself into triggering situations on a daily basis didn&#8217;t ring true to me.  To be honest I don&#8217;t have experience with battered women though, so her actions might be completely normal for some individuals. Her paranoia and constant fear of discovery just didn&#8217;t seem like healthy energy to bring into groups of women who were already stressed from their experiences with their attackers.  I also want to believe that battered women&#8217;s shelters vet their volunteers more thoroughly than they seemed to with Rachel, but without firsthand experience I can&#8217;t say one way or the other.My other issue with Rachel was her constant need for a Prince Charming.  I realize she was probably a little emotionally stunted due to her bizarre upbringing, but it&#8217;s just not healthy for a twenty-six year old woman to still expect a prince to rescue her.  I was especially incensed at Rachel&#8217;s memory about telling her mother a story about a princess that she couldn&#8217;t end because there was no prince to rescue the princess.  Instead of telling her daughter that princesses can also rescue themselves, Rachel&#8217;s mom got upset and asked for the story to be re-written with a prince.  Sadly it primed the young woman to fall for someone incapable of loving her as a person and allow him to hurt her to soothe his temper.If I had serious problems with one of the main characters how did I enjoy the book? Martin used the section portion of the book to explore Rachel&#8217;s past thoroughly and helped show the person she was before abuse and control constantly kept her fearful. I also admired her strength at leaving her abuser even though she ran scared to avoid being found.  Mark also added stability to Rachel&#8217;s ephemeral life, and he proved himself to be a decent man throughout the story.  Even when he learned the full darkness of his girlfriend&#8217;s past Mark refused to turn away from her because his love meant that he accepted her for who she was, not who he wanted her to be.Overall, False Security isn&#8217;t precisely romantic suspense, but it definitely is suspense with romantic elements.  It&#8217;s not a perfect book, but if you want to see a fictional account of Stockholm Syndrome and how one woman freed herself from its grasp, this is a fabulous read.  It kept me riveted and entertained despite my critiques.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice light suspense read with romantic elements", "unixReviewTime": 1389916800, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2014"}

It&#8217;s 1939 at the outset of World War II and not a good place for those who live there.  Phillip is the youngest son of Englishman Noel Hutton and his second wife, a much younger Chinese woman who died many years earlier.  In a beautiful scene of father and son communication, Noel tells Phillip of the night he was conceived.  This fact of his parentage puts Phillip as an outcast, neither British nor Chinese, but leads him to a deep friendship with Endo, a Japanese diplomat who takes on the role of Phillip&#8217;s tutor or sensei.Recalling the history of Japan&#8217;s invasion of China, Korea and Malaya, you&#8217;ll have a pretty good idea of what happens when the war starts and the Japanese are needing the rich natural resources of Malaya&#8217;s tin mines and rubber plantations.  You know what&#8217;s coming and, as you empathize with the characters, you hope they&#8217;ll be spared.Noel is the owner of a large company and makes great efforts to keep it operating.  Phillip believes that he must cooperate with the Japanese in order to safeguard his family and finds himself walking a dangerous tightrope. His loyalty to Endo tugs at him in one direction while the recriminations of his siblings and local citizens pull in another.During the inevitable conflicts which arise, Phillip learns more about his mother when he visits his Chinese grandfather and asks many questions.  Grandfather obliges with much detail about his earlier life, enabling Phillip to gain more insight into a rich heritage that helps him navigate the perilous path he&#8217;s chosen.The war ends, as all wars do, and Phillip survives to face an uncertain future.  I&#8217;m not revealing the plot here because, at the book&#8217;s beginning, Phillip is the narrator in his late seventies who has witnessed a great deal of suffering by both natives and invaders alike.

Oh did we mention that Ford came to office without warning and therefore without a game plan? This makes the Obama and Reagan problems that they inherited seem tame!I never thought of President Ford in this light until I read this book. I did not have an opinion of him one way or the other, but I have a new found respect for Ford. You can disagree with his decisions, but you have to admire the swiftness and firmness that he handled these complex situations with no warnings. The book is easy to read, covers his entire life including his childhood, and time in Congress. He does an excellent job putting you in his shoes at that time period. Putting into perspective many of the decisions that he made without being apologetic. He lays his cards on the table and says &#34;this is what I was dealt and this is how I handled it.&#34;  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the 1970s, presidents or just how the world seems like it is always crumbling!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent autobiography of an under-rated president", "unixReviewTime": 1398729600, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2014"}

I really liked this book.  The interactions between the hero and heroine were engaging.  Dante Dimitriou (the hero) was likeable from the start.  He agrees to do the reality show to help out his friend Connor.  I could tell early on that he was attracted to the heroine.  It just took him awhile to figure it out.  She is definitely not the type he is used to dating.  I think her uniqueness is what attracts him in the first place.  Zoe Parker (the heroine) is tricked by her best friend Sarah.  She thinks she is going on a blind date, but when she arrives finds out it is a reality show.  The only reason she stays is so her friend does not get into trouble(she had forged her name on documents).  She does not even consider Dante as someone she could be with.  She is actually more attracted to the show's host Kyle.  Their romance is drawn out slowly, but not in a way that bores you.The Story:  Dante is the bachelor on a reality dating show and Zoe is a reluctant participant.  Dante is instantly intrigued by her after seeing her on a hidden camera.  Zoe was calling her friend and trying to bail on the show.  Dante decides to keep her on the show as a friend.  After the initial meet and greet, Dante slips her a note to meet him in a hotel suite.  She does and Dante tells her he wants her to stay as his friend.  She is kind of insulted and wants to leave so he blackmails her to stay.  She does not stay mad at him long.  He is just so irresistible.The next day, they leave for France. On the plane over, Kyle talks and flirts with her.  When they land, they go to Dante's chateau.  The next morning, Zoe decides to check out the town and Kyle offers to drive her.  They spend the day together.  When they arrive back for dinner, they are late.  Dante is not amused.  He is jealous, but does not yet realize why.  He requests to talk to her and later that night he berates her over her behavior.The rest of the book deals with their bumpy road to an eventual HEA.  I love the way the ending was written.

There is even a Wickham and Mr. Collins. I really enjoyed matching up the characters as I read the book. It made really fun.I really enjoyed the time travel aspect of Project Darcy. Jane Austen&#8217;s story really made the book engaging and fun. Ellie&#8217;s story, on the other hand, wasn&#8217;t quite as engaging. Her Mr. Darcy wasn&#8217;t very likeable and didn&#8217;t turn out to be HER Mr. Darcy. I found the ending to be a little disconnected from the story. It didn&#8217;t make much sense to me.However, I found Jane Austen and Mr. Lefroy&#8217;s romance to very to be very charming and touching as well. Jane is portrayed as someone who is fun-loving and flirtatious; not the serious spinster that people might attribute to her. Their relationship seemed a little illicit and passionate. I truly hope that Miss Austen experienced passion in her life amidst her disappointment. I felt her story was the most potent storyline of Project Darcy. I wanted to know more and I was a little disappointed when Ellie would return to her own time.Overall, I really enjoyed Project Darcy. I loved the Jane Austen bits of the book. The only thing I found disappointing was how Ellie found her ultimate love interest. It was very romantic but didn&#8217;t make sense to me.

Emma Chase presents an insight into the couple&#8217;s relationship two years down the road and I&#8217;m happy to say that Drew and Kate&#8217;s love life is more sizzling and hotter than ever. (The kitchen scene was spectacular &#8211; *swoon*) Kate is still stubborn and Drew is just&#8230;Drew. He&#8217;s still witty, sexy, charming, adorable and most of all - EXASPERATING.Things seem to be hunky dory for our delightful couple until suddenly a HUGE misunderstanding takes place, altering their lives forever. (Misunderstanding is an understatement &#8211; the domino effect of this event is immeasurable).  Drew behaves like a total a-hole, but that&#8217;s par for the course.  He manages to hurt Kate in such a way that turns both their lives upside down.  UGH! I wanted to slap him so hard and scream &#8220;WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU&#8221;!Alas, Drew crushed Kate&#8217;s heart. Yes, he was irrational. Yes, he single-handily screwed up their relationship. And yes, his stupidity causes both to be miserable and brokenhearted.  I do not fault Kate for being angry, for Drew is completely to blame for the riff created.  Drew, you son of a bitch &#8211; you frustrated the s*** out of me.Needless to say, Kate is not the type of chick who puts up with crap. So, she takes some time to reflect and tries to put her life back together.  It is here we see a different side of Kate as she re-connects with her family, old friends and Billy.  Of course Dee Dee pops in, ball busting and providing Kate with the much-needed comic relief during this dismal time. I felt horrible for Kate. Enduring such sorrow, as her life is shattered leaving her in limbo. BUT, Kate did manage to severely piss me off with her reprehensible actions and crazy thoughts. These two characters really tried my patience, & I loved every minute of it.Things become difficult for Drew during this time. (Good, he deserves it for being such an a-hole). Just when I had my fill of his shenanigans, he surprises me.  The jovial jokester channels his serious side &#8211; and treats Kate to an emotional outburst proclaiming his undying love for her. Who would have thought Drew could pull sincerity off?  Phew, so happy these two FINALLY managed to clear the air and work through their issues.  It was a rough and tumble roll through much of their story. Now, all is good in the world of Drew and he&#8217;s back to the wisecracking snarky bastard I&#8217;ve come to love.All in all, I enjoyed this read.  It was more serious than I would have imagined, based on the first installment, but it did not disappoint.

He was hers - simple as that. Of course, he was just a seventeen year old and he never met the girl, but whatever. He knew she was it for him.I loved, LOVED this story. Let me count the ways!1. Cash RowlandIf there ever was a voice I've enjoyed reading it was his. He was adorable and funny as hell. I loved not only his humor but his loyalty and tender ways. I loved that this story was told from his point of view, I don't think I would have loved it as much if it weren't. It fit the story.2. The RomanceWho doesn't remember their first love? Who doesn't enjoy a 'second chance at love' story? This one had it both and it was fantastic.3. The StorySweet, with a dash of intense emotions, Cash and Piper's journey of love had all the elements I've come to expect in a great romantic story. Plenty of 'Aww' inducing moments, characters that complemented each other and felt real throughout, appropriate emotions that captured each character's frame of mind and chemistry that although tamed in the page still shined through.I loved how the author went about bringing them together. Their adventure as they traveled in Cash's truck was entertaining and enlightening. There were elements of the story that surprised me, but complimented it and made it sweeter. The characters' emotions jumped off the page and their personalities never wavered. They grew as individuals as the story progressed, but it was their growth as a couple and how their connection strengthened that made this such a fantastic read for me.If you like your stories sweet with a dash of humor and adventure I say that you pick this book right now. It had that and much more. This is one story that will go on my 'favorites' shelf for those times when I need a little pick me up.

Max, a lead male character has issues that were never explained and twist towards the end that still made no sense.

He is attracted to Jane&#8217;s and Elizabeth&#8217;s beauty and Charlotte&#8217;s agreeable nature, but he completely overlooks plain Mary, who, with her preference of sermons, serious nature, and fondness for counseling others, would perhaps be the ideal candidate. I&#8217;ve always wondered if Mr. Collins ever thought of Mary Bennet, if he even noticed her. Did he see their compatibility and ignore it? In Jack Caldwell&#8217;s newest novel he explores what happens when Mr. Collin&#8217;s sees Mary and proposes to her instead of Elizabeth&#8230;So how does Mary marrying Mr. Collins change the story for the other characters, you ask? Well, the Netherfield party still departs to London, but because her sister is soon to be married, Jane Bennet doesn&#8217;t venture there herself. She instead accompanies Elizabeth on a long visit to Hunsford Parsonage (that&#8217;s right, no Maria Lucas!). Where we learn that Mary and Anne de Bourgh don&#8217;t remain indifferent acquaintances with each other, but instead become fast friends.What I loved most about this story was seeing all the positive results of Mr. Collins&#8217;s marriage to Mary! Mary&#8217;s development and improvement was wonderful to witness; she handles Mr. Collins masterfully and truly comes into her own. And now that the sisters are separated by a distance of &#8220;nearly fifty miles,&#8221; they seem to value each other more and their increased sisterly affection for each other was heartwarming to observe. In addition, I loved how Mary, while respectful and kind towards Lady Catherine, did not worship her with the same absolute veneration that her husband is prone to do and often steered him in a better direction than his &#8220;esteemed patroness.&#8221; Go Mary!Mary&#8217;s maturity and development isn&#8217;t the only pleasing one to witness in this tale, Anne de Bourgh, while under the guidance and support of her new friend is finally becoming the woman she has always longed to be. Taking secret music lessons, driving carriages, interfering with her cousin&#8217;s relationship, trying to attract a certain suitor&#8230;I liked seeing Anne take a more active part in the plot!While I loved the premise of this variation and enjoyed seeing the changes it wrought, I did often wish that the story deviated a little more. There were a lot of familiar scenes and similar conversations, and it seemed like Mary marrying Mr. Collins had more impact on Jane and Bingley then it did Darcy and Elizabeth. (Loved how Jane handled Mr. Bingley! Go Jane!) The course of Darcy and Elizabeth&#8217;s relationship seemed to be the same, even with the help of Darcy&#8217;s well-meaning cousins and Elizabeth&#8217;s matchmaking sister. I found myself enjoying the Jane/Bingley relationship in this story more than the Darcy/Elizabeth one, especially when Elizabeth makes a brazen and assumptive declaration to Mr. Darcy&#8230;(that just felt odd.)Part of me wished this variation stayed with and focused on Mary, Anne, and Jane, but you can&#8217;t have a Pride and Prejudice variation without Darcy and Elizabeth!!

These are: 1) a dying population; 2) mass immigration; 3) rise of an anti-Western culture; and 4) the  breakup of nations and rise of world government.Looking at how these apply to the United States, where I have lived my whole life, I agree with Buchanan's conclusion but not his reasoning used to reach that conclusion. It is clear that the U.S. is in serious decline, and the evidence for this shows up almost everywhere one looks these days. There is an epidemic of obesity in this country. No country can remain strong when its population is so unhealthy. Our health care system continues to sink in comparison to other countries. We spend twice as much as other countries on health care, with results that by any measure put us only about 30th compared to other developed countries.Our national government is completely dysfunctional, unable any longer to govern. We spend more on the military than the next 12 or 13 countries combined! We are addicted to military intervention in other sovereign countries, even though we would never tolerate another country doing the same to us. We seem unable to live within our means, both on a personal level and on a governmental level. The federal deficit still runs to unheard-of amounts, meaning our national debt is skyrocketing yearly.On a personal level, our savings rate has become negative for the first time in history. We seem unable to grasp the concept of deferred gratification; rather, we insist on having it all immediately. We evaluate ideas and programs and policies not on the basis of long-term benefit, but on the basis of what the immediate effect is of said plans.We incarcerate far more of our citizens than any other country in the world, contributing to the financial crisis we face. Our citizens are 20 times more likely than those in other developed countries to face gun violence, due to the epidemic of guns and gun-related violence in this country. We seem unable to do anything about this epidemic, even though 90% of us believe that better background checks are needed for someone buying a firearm.We have become a nation of whiners, rather than a nation of doers. It used to be that when we suffered a setback, we would resolve to work harder and pull ourselves out of the difficulties we face. Now, we look for someone to blame, even to sue. (A Little League coach just sued one of his players for throwing his helmet in celebration of scoring a game-winning run.)These are the kinds of reasons explaining America's decline, not the xenophobic and homophobic reasons advanced by Buchanan. Buchanan says that the dying population is the \"most dangerous\" of his four cited dangers. And yet, he is opposed to allowing the immigration levels which would ameliorate the problem of the low birthrate. He is, however, strongly opposed to abortion and homosexuality, and part of the reason for his opposition is that these two issues contribute to the dying population problem.Buchanan abhors what he calls the \"de-Christianizing\" of America. He is unable to see the wisdom of the separation of church and state, and it is obvious he thinks the government should actively promote Christianity. This is an insidious notion in and of itself. However, the true problem with Buchanan's position here is that it is not Christianity in general which he espouses; rather, it is a very narrow brand of fundamentalist and socially conservative Christianity, a brand which condemns birth control, abortion, divorce, homosexuality, feminism, artistic freedom, and the lack of prayer and Christian symbols in schools.The tragedy of this misguided book is that people who read it might be so turned off that they will then overlook Buchanan's very excellent books on foreign policy. \"Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War\", and \"Where the Right Went Wrong\" are exceptionally perceptive books, full of meticulous research and well-reasoned criticisms of U.S. war policy. Readers should skip \"The Death of the West\" and instead immerse themselves in these other two books.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Buchanan Strikes Out", "unixReviewTime": 1389744000, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2014"}

She tries to explain the facts without really picking one side or the other, and for the most part she does just that.  The subject is so delicate that it is very hard to say anything about teaching without offending.The parts where she comes up with potential solutions is interesting, but not really elaborated on with the level to convince.

When I started reading it, I noticed that the author had a writing style similar to another author that I had trouble with reading because she was pretty slow paced, but my fears were unmerited. This book was a pretty good read! Not a favorite, but I did enjoy it. It wasn't slow moving, as my friend had claimed, but instead it kept me interested until the very end. I'm not saying that it was a super fast paced story that had me sitting on the edge of my seat biting my fingernails, but I had no problem concentrating on it, and toward the end things really started to pick up.

Is this book a romance book or a historical novel? As a romance, it failed for me as the romance between the lead characters never really explored issues of race and never seemed believable. Every lead character is \"completelty rationale\" in how they are understood by the other leads and they never argue or disagree with each other but just jump to they next act... The lead characters would have been more believeable if they had arguements or disagreements where they had to work their cultural differences and personality issues out. All the major characters are from very different backgrounds and cultures and it seems hard to believe they would never have any misunderstandings or disagreements (i.e. when Song told the piano player she was going to the communist headquarters; would she really have left without an arguement or discussion?). This book had so much potential to explore serious issues!The story of the Chinese and China as a safe haven for Jews during world war 2 was in competition with the character development of the book's main story, but in the end, learning about it partially redeemed this book.

In the second half of the book the author attempts to compare these various behaviors of bears to early man and postulated that man's behaviors have developed not from chimpanzees but from this more &#34;bearlike&#34; behavioral pattern. It is a very interesting notion and the evidence provided by the author is solid, but I was not expecting the book to go in this direction and found myself longing for more insights into black bear behavior and cognition.

Dreams about the future, healing dreams, shamanic dreams, dreams about the deceased and spiritual entities, counselling dreams. Anything and everything about the world of dreams is in this book. There are plenty of real dreams examples mentioned as an example, all of them interesting and surprising, and they come from Moss' own oniric world and from his circle of friends and workshops participants. Also part of his dreamwork approach is the world of synchronicity and active imagination, and they are also considered in the book.The advantage of this book with regards to Conscious Dreaming, to me, is that here Moss devotes time to guide practical exercises, the ones with drumming including, so you will be able to put into practice his advice, even if you are alone at home and you don't have a drum. Moss will be your master of ceremonies.Robert Moss is a great narrator. Unlike other audio books, Dream Gates is not only informative, it is also entertaining.

It begins by defining the &#34;blue line&#34; of what is actual value for a company.  Not a stock price or assets, but a deeper perspective that involves understanding how both employees and consumers view an entity and how they assess it.  For example, it offers the perspective that most employees of Enron had likely no idea what was happening to its investors: this asks, why  not?  Why weren't employees aware of the big picture behind the firm they were the face of?  In that case, a true &#34;blue line&#34; would have helped both consumer and corporation to see their real value and depth.The big takeaway is that this book teaches how employers can assist employees to change their learning methods and create a more proactive depth in the company: one chart is especially useful in showing how making a conscious effort to learn, to be open to new ideas helps the company grow exponentially, whereas traditional belief structures for business may hamstring an employee from really learning and growing in a way  that assists the company. Thus, in some cases, a newbie with a fresh outlook may challenge the beliefs of an old-timer and the business has to decide whether to change or remain stagnant.

I will say that the filmmakers stuck fairly close to Fleming's source material for their film. Most of the elements found in the film can also be found here; death by gold paint, Bond strapped to table about to be cut in half (a laser in the movie, a buzzsaw in the novel), Oddjob's deadly hat, and so much more. With that said, I was kind of shocked that I didn't really care for this novel. For some reason the pacing for this novel just feels off.After a brief run-in with Auric Goldfinger in Miami, Bond learns that Goldfinger may be a gold smuggler and the Bank of England wants Bond to investigate. Bond manages to arrange a run-in with Goldfinger on the golf course. We get a battle of wits and wills on the golf course, and before long Bond is following Goldfinger around Europe.Criss-crossing the globe, &#34;Goldfinger&#34; see Bond travel from America, to Switzerland and back to America again. Goldfinger's scheme is ingenius, and one of the best parts of the novel is Goldfinger's partners in crime, a variety of colorful American gangsters including the iconicly named Pussy Galore. Oddjob is also a lot of fun.This novel's pacing is definately a tale of two halves. The first half is somewhat dull. Bond trying to catch Goldfinger cheating at cards, and the entire reason that M assigns Bond to the Goldfinger case seems odd? Why turn Bond into the taxman? From the way Fleming portrays Goldfinger's actions, it almost seems like Goldfinger is simply trying to keep the government out of his finances, and avoid paying a higher tax....I could relate to that. But we see as the story plays out that Goldfiner is actually a money-man behind SMERSH, that there is good reason to put Bond on his trail. Right up until the golf game, the pace is pretty slow, but as soon as Goldfinger leaves for Europe, the novel picks up.

Wend", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "A Gladiator Only Dies Once is the second collection of short stories by Steven Saylor in his Roma Sub Rosa series.  This set of stories gives more background on Gordianus the Finder and puts him in some grave danger in the process.In the first story, The Consul&#8217;s Wife, Gordianus is asked to investigate whether the newly elected consul Decimus Brutus is in danger of being murdered by his wife Sempronia.  The story includes chariot races at the Circus Maximus, and it is a delight to read an accurate description of the races instead of something modeled after a Hollywood movie.  If a Cyclops Could Vanish in the Blink of an Eye concerns Gordianus&#8217; domestic life.  Eco is missing some of his favorite toys (figurines of Cerberus, Cyclops etc) and there is no explanation of how they are disappearing. In The White Fawn, Gordianus undertakes dangerous mission to Spain to convince Lucius, the grandson of patrician Gaius Claudius, to return home.  The young man has gone to Spain to join the rebellion of Sertorious, and Gordianus has to tread carefully so the rebels do not take him for a spy and the Roman troops seeking to destroy Sertorius do not mistake him for a rebel.  Something Fishy in Pompeii is an entertaining story involving Lucius Claudius and something suspicious going on at his garum factory in Pompeii. Archimedes Tomb is an interesting story that takes place in Sicily, and brings back Cicero, who was serving a term as the Roman administrator of the western half of the island.  Gordianus and Eco are visiting Sicily on business and are invited to dinner by Cicero, who has invited three Sicilians as well; dinner, however, leads to murder.Death by Eros is a more straightforward murder mystery where a seemingly popular young man has been killed at a gymnasium, just after winning an athletic competition.  The title story, A Gladiator Only Dies Twice, finds Gordianus in danger when he is hired to find the gladiator brother of a woman.  The difficulty is that he was killed in a fight but apparently was seen alive.  Life for Gordianus gets more complicated when the woman who hired him insists on accompanying him on the search.  Poppy and the Poisoned Cake deals with an historical figure &#8211; Lucius Gellius Poplicola, who is one of the Censors.  Poppy is fond of some cakes made by a local baker. One day, the slave who fetched the cake had a little taste and died on the spot, and Gordianus needs to find the would-be murderer while taking care to keep what he is doing a secret. The final story &#8211; The Cherries of Lucullus &#8211; involves the famous Roman general who defeated Mithradates.  Gordianus is summoned to investigate a slave who may be trying to kill the general.Steven Saylor is not only a superb writer of mysteries; he also deftly provides a history of Roman private life in his stories.  In this volume, the reader finds out quite a lot about what it was like to attend a chariot race, the making of garum, a history lesson about Sicily, an interesting perspective on gladiatorial fighting, the functions of the office of Censor and how cherries were introduced to the western world.  The only comment I have is that gladiators fought with a referee present who could stop the fighting, if necessary.  Such a figure is not included in the title story.  The story works better if there isn&#8217;t a referee but it is inaccurate to how gladiators fought. This aside, Mr. Saylor is a fabulous writer and one finishes one of his books looking forward to the next one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Wonderful Book of Stories", "unixReviewTime": 1401148800, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2014"}

This greatly enhances the appreciation of what Newton achieved and how he did it.The purely technical content of the book is spiced with sufficient additional information about the man, his contemporaries and successors to provide a human interest factor as relief to its logical rigours without veering from its main purpose.The comprehensive and explanatory references to the additional information available to those wishing to soak themselves even more thoroughly in appreciation of Newton's genius is another notable feature of the book.It is not a book for the mathematically illiterate, but it is not intended to be and that is certainly not a shortcoming.As befits such a massive subject, it's a pretty hard slog through, but the long tramp is well worth it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A competent guide", "unixReviewTime": 1389657600, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2014"}

She writes so fluidly and uses great descriptions to pull you into the story. Ruby Hill is another one of those stories that pulls you in.The two main characters are ones that I'm sure that every other review has talked about, Ashley and Corbin.

They're investigating a series of murders that have occurred at the old abandoned asylum, Ruby Hill. Of course, there is also the connection of Corbin's brother, Cash, as he died there as well.The other character that stands out, is that of the Asylum. You can't dismiss it as not being a character, because of the presence that it has in the novel. I have to say that Ballance is very good at turning old buildings and locales into an essential part of the story. She did the same in her short story &#8220;Hawthorne&#8221; and she does the same in this novel. As you read, the descriptions make it seem all the more real, as the characters move around and about the old building. To me, having the ability to do that and transport the reader TO the location, is a skill that a great writer has.Overall, this is is a suspenseful romance, a quick ghost story, but I won't spill too much.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; there have been many classic works set in the Star Trek Universe that stand up against anything ever written in the science fiction genre.  But this one in particular just stands out.  The characterisation is outstanding.  Initially a little daunting, the book is very, very wordy but after a few pages, one begins to see the wood for the trees and suddenly the reader can see the sense of all the talk.  We get to know Captain John Harriman and his elite crew.  We get to know his family, his love life, their history and his personal future and plans.  His personal life alone is well depicted and even that aspect of the story is worth the price of admission alone.  Naturally, we are already familiar with the ship Harriman and his crew have been blessed to serve on.  And of course the footfalls of the current crew echo against the ghosts of Kirk, Spock and McCoy et al who traversed the same ship and its passage ways many times in the past, much to the Federation's glory.Tension and political intrigue abound throughout this interstellar tale, which hints at a possible allegiance between the Klingons and (gasp!) the Romulans, along with the ever present threats of double cross and duplicity.  They both seem to think the Federation are being duplicitous themselves by developing a&#34;meta weapon&#34; - the likes of which the galaxy has never seen.  Of course us Fans of the Federation know (from faith alone) the exact opposite, and are fascinated as we learn and witness what the good guys are actually developing.That is the plan, anyway.  Naturally, I won't reveal what happens but a star trek novel this complex and sophisticated would not be worth the paper it is printed on if the plot did not twist in as many unexpected ways as possible.  And this one does.Humour has never had a major role to play in a star trek novel.  This one is no different.  But against the threat of interstellar war, and rumours of mega weapons powerful enough to destroy planets in the blink of an eye, it would be totally out of place.  But Star Trek bas never been about making you laugh.  It is about technology, exploration, moments of gasp-inducing discoveries and senses of wonder.It is also about humanity and learning what it means to be human.This book delivers on all fronts.Full marks for this classic.BFN Greggorio!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "ONE OF THE ALL TIME GREATS!!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1396569600, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2014"}

One that is full of interesting characters and gives a glimpse into one day in the lives of the characters, not enough for the whole picture or even the whole truth (things may be very different than they seem), but enough to make you wonder...In the first episode, which happens to be Ordinary Secrets, the scene is set for a gala honoring the town's most loved teacher, Quinn.  That's his last name, by the way.  His real name is Ted or Teddy, or Theodore, something like that, but everyone just calls him Quinn.  He has been the high school history teacher for thirty years now, and because of the impact he has had on his students and his town, a gala has been scheduled to honor him.  The only thing is, he doesn't want to be honored.  He seems to be a humble man who enjoys helping others, but does not want public recognition.Throw in the town mayor, Sylvia, who is also the owner of one of the local shops and who has loved Quinn for nearly all of the thirty years he has been in town, who even went RING shopping with him at one point, and you start to get some suspense.  Then add former students who left years ago and are returning only because of their love for Quinn.  One in particular, Ethan, is finishing up his fifth of six years of his neurosurgical residency; if it weren't for that handwritten note from Quinn, Ethan would not have showed up.  A personal request for a heart to heart with Quinn cannot be refused. There is a newly arrived trial lawyer by the name of Jack Parker who along with his family is escaping big city life and it's accompanying problems.  Liam is a respected financier who is afraid of commitment and is also hiding a secret; his younger brother Cooper is with the sheriff's department.  Nicole is an ace reporter who works the crime scene in the big city and once dated Ethan for a long period of time, but that relationship fell to the wayside with their differing life decisions.  Lauren, a girl who returned home and works for the church, is nervous about an upcoming church project in which she seems to have no control but in which Quinn has assured her everything has been handled.  And we can't leave out Dani, a woman who does odd jobs for everyone around town but is uncomfortable in public settings.  There you have it, a great mix. You get a glimpse of each character's life, just enough to know that there might be some secrets buried under the surface, but we'll just have to dig.This episode opens on Saturday morning of the big day, and ends just as everyone is about to be re-introduced to their teacher and mentor, Quinn.  A loud noise goes off -- no problem, someone set the cannon to the wrong time (cannon?).  Introductions continue, the curtain is raised, and...........  Hmm, come back next week to find out what happened!Ordinary Secrets is the first episode in a series of thirteen which are set to be released on a weekly basis beginning January 24, 2014.  It will take no time at all to read this first episode.

This series is NOT a standalone series. DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW if you haven&#8217;t read HOLDING ON (book 1).Talk about pulling the rug out from under me and slapping me with it!Here&#8217;s the thing about AC Bextor. Her stories know no boundaries. Her writing is so gripping you feel as though you are witnessing the scene in person. When the POV changes your role also changes, and instead of being the grieving widow, you are now the sister or best friend of the victim. The picture she paints is colorful, fast-paced and mysterious, yet organized and through. Readers that enjoy alpha bikers know they come with attitude and drama. They are foul-mouthed, demanding, HAWT beings, and their passion is rugged to the extreme. The Lights of Peril club is no different; it&#8217;s the story that makes them unique. AC doesn&#8217;t focus solely on one couple, she is writing about the club; the love, the relationships, the scandals, the abuse and the enemies.The characters we grew to love in Holding On return and are more explosive and emotional than before. For Sadey, the sun is no longer warm and comforting, it&#8217;s a reminder that she must go another day without Hem, yet be strong enough to adapt to motherhood. When she nurtures her baby the face looking back at her is Hem, another constant reminder. And ironically when Patrick is fussy, the childish behavior is also linked to Hem. Life will never be the same; memories and pain have become their only constant.&#8220;You&#8217;re not the only one hurting here sweetheart.&#8221; &#8211;Shame to SadeyAce is the first ray of sunlight in this story. He was the alpha biker I grew to love and I wanted him to have an impact in this book&#8230;and I got my wish. Upon his return he gives Sadey a glimmer of normalcy. In Holding On, Ace&#8217;s departure was sudden and the reason was withheld from Sadey. She has a lot of questions, but most of all she just wants/needs her friend back; she needs the comfort and security.&#34;Do you know what it&#8217;s like to love someone so powerfully, with everything you have inside you, but they can&#8217;t love you back?&#8221; &#8211;Ace to SadeyHem offered his life in return for his loved one&#8217;s safety. It&#8217;s a deal with no signature, and in the MC world, rules are always broken. This club is fighting for their life, and their enemies are fighting for power and revenge. Sadey and the club face this assault head on, but now, emotionally, they are different people. It&#8217;s not only about loving, it&#8217;s about the possibly that history could repeat itself. That&#8217;s what will break them.&#8220;He knew what he was doing when he left us, Shame. He knew.

It is the second book in the Elements Trilogy. If you haven't read the book for the first book Unknown, you might wish to at least read the review here, first. This is not a stand-alone novel.Unseen picks up in the icy mountains in a snow storm where Unknown left off. Jethro, Kyla and the two element children Mya and Adamar are headed toward Doran where they are looking for the wind element child.Back in Taramon, Athra continues to watch Princess Kyla's progress through the use of the magic map rather than trusting in the prophecy. He also continues to secretly train his army of soldiers in the dungeon of the castle in preparation for taking a stand against the dark forces of Ashan.As Kyla, Jethro, Adamar and Mya locate the wind element Cori and the fire element Eshron, Kyla and Jethro discover their love for one another and struggle to deal with that and Kyla's betrothal to Athra. Kyla fights within herself over her belief/unbelief in the prophecy and in Oron.I really liked how Ms. Pearl so beautifully brought the basic elements of the Christian faith into her novel. All the parallels are there. Oron willingly gave up his life for the people just as Christ did. Oron said he would return, just as Christ said He would, and so on. But it's not just a book for Christians, because it's also a book about the basic fight of good against evil, of light against dark.The children also had to work together at times to defeat their enemy. I appreciated that message. We are not islands. We need each other and cannot exist in isolation. There were so many great messages woven into this novel.I enjoyed the character development of Kyla and Jethro. Kyla does not really want to be Queen. She does not love Athra, but accepts the arranged marriage as it is her duty and she knows that Athra will be a good king, and he is a good man, but she feels like it is a prison sentence. She'd much rather run away. She blames Oron and is angry at him for all that she has gone through in her life. Then she comes to see that it had all been part of Oron's plan and she had to make a choice - to follow her own plan for her life, or to follow Oron's plan for her life.Melissa Pearl has done it again with another 5 star novel that will reside on my favourites shelf.

Lonnie is a slender, beautiful native american who has had a very challenging life. Nothing has come easily for Lonnie. His mother was dead and his father and Uncle Channing were drowning in the same alcohol that had nearly gotten Lonnie killed. He was still struggling with his addiction and he did not know what to do.Travis has finally accepted that he is gay. He longs to find someone who can love him despite his wealth, and he feels the pull to the BDSM world as a Dom. He has struggled with accepting his new place in the world, and he finds himself drawn to Lonnie, but unsure as how his new found dominance can work in a relationship with Lonnie. After getting thrown out of the BDSM club for a failing attitude, Master Lin urges him to find someone he cares about to explore whether or not he can be trusted in the club. When he comes to care so much about Lonnie, Master Lin begins his training.Not everyone is accepting of the lifestyle lived by the Sheriff and the Deputy. Roark wants to be the Sheriff, and Travis's father wants to be Councilman so they can railroad through a resort that will destroy the towns atmosphere. How far either one of them will go to reach their goals is anyone's guess, but when push comes to shove, will love be able to conquer the hatred of those things not understood? How hard can these men fight to feel the freedom to live their lives? Can Travis and the town rally against the threats facing them? How far will the bad guys go to achieve their desires? We know Roark is not one of the good guys, but how much evil is lurking under the surface? Where will Lack and Rebel's love take them now that they are moving on with their lives?

He goes further to argue that we must explicitly grant ourselves the permission to fail, and that often times, the best way to become an expert and to set ourselves up for success is to intentionally set out doing the wrong things first. Robby goes on to describe different strategies to make this happen: make a mess, ignore popular wisdom, discard recommended approaches, complete tasks out of order, fail to follow the norm, tell white lies.Following failure, the author points out a key difference between companies (or individuals) that fail and those that succeed after a failure and that has to do with the mindset. Robby reminds us that: &#34;we must work with failure, not against it...The ultimate question will be whether or not failure is merely a pattern or a part of a larger perspective on success.&#34;On a concluding note Robby states that: &#34;The highest levels of achievement can only be pursued if we're willing to suffer through the mistakes and missteps needed to discover the path to success. Errors are the landmarks on the route to victory.&#34;...with a counterbalancing reminder from journalist Paul Brown: &#34;...Even though we can understand the importance of failure, it's still hard to internalize embracing our mistakes.&#34;Overall, a quick, enjoyable and inspiring read.

Then Karen Armstrong came out with A History of God, and I knew I had been beaten at my own game. Whether you are deeply religious, religiously indifferent, an agnostic or an atheist, if you haven&#8217;t read A History of God you are missing out on what I will call the best summary every written on a matter of no small importance. As Armstrong says in her introduction,&#8220;All talk about God staggers under impossible difficulties. Yet monotheists have all been very positive about language at the same time as they have denied its capacity to express the transcendent reality. The God of Jews, Christians and Muslims is a God who&#8212;in some sense&#8212;speaks. His Word is crucial in all three faiths. The Word of God has shaped the history of our culture. We have to decide whether the word &#8216;God&#8217; has any meaning for us today.&#8221;Now there is a new book that boggles my mind. Sixty years ago when I took  &#8220;An Introduction to Greek Philosophy,&#8221; it changed my life. I have been reading Plato, Aristotle, and various neo-Platonists and neo-Aristotelians ever since. So when Rebecca Goldstein published Plato at the Googleplex: Why Philosophy Won&#8217;t Go Away, I was extremely well prepared for it, but the book simply blows me out of the water. It is ingenious: she entwines the skills of a novelist with her mastery of the scholarship of what Plato achieved, and writes a book that is as enchanting as it is comprehensible. To see how she proves that philosophy won&#8217;t go away, you need only read a few of her litany of responses on page 56:&#8220;When we disagree over whether the 1 percent really contribute more to society than the 99 percent and whether, if they do, their contributions should be recognized in the form of increased privileges or increased obligations, Plato is there.&#8221;&#8220;When we argue over what the role of the state is, whether it is there to protect us or to perfect us, then there is Plato.&#8221;&#8220;When we argue over whether ethical truths are inextricably tied to religious truths, then there is Plato.&#8221;&#8220;When we wonder whether there is a real difference between right and wrong, or whether we are only making it up as we go along, then there is Plato.&#8221;----Ah, you get the message! The unexamined life is not worth living, and if you feel you need a little more examining in your life, then pick up either one of these books, and you will reap the rewards of encountering really great minds&#8230;minds who have thought about the problems you and I think about all the time, and will enable us to think much more profoundly about things that are really well worth our time and attention, and which can enrich our lives immeasurably in the process&#8230;", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best New Book On Philosophy!", "unixReviewTime": 1396137600, "reviewTime": "03 30, 2014"}

If you liked the first two, then this one will be a winner as well. It is still a light-hearted, funny tale of Britt and her knights.The only thing I had a problem with was the length. It seemed like I finished it in no time. It may have just been me, because I've been waiting on pins and needles for this book for a while, but I was hoping for something longer. Also, this isn't the last book in the series. It has a very open ending. Just FYI. At least, it HOPE it isn't the last book. There are a lot of issues left unanswered.Also, there were a few typos, unwieldy sentences, things like that. It didn't bother me one bit, but I know some people are really ticky about things like that, so I thought I'd mention it.Spoilers below*************Okay, so Lancelot AND Guinevere show up in this book. Britt ends up saving G, despite her dislike of the shallow, flightly girl. Lancelot ends up tagging along with Britt for most of the book and seems like a rather oblivious likable fellow until the ending. The author shows a private conversation between Lancelot and his friends that was very...odd. Very out of character for Lancelot, so its looking like he has hidden depths, and that it won't be in Britt's favor. I already wasn't very fond of Lancelot, and was cheering Britt on every time she dissed him, so after that ominous ending, I REALLY hope she gives him the boot.And this is off topic, but there are very brief hints of a budding romance between Britt and Merlin. In case you were cheering for that. Which I definitely AM. Although I don't have any idea how that would work within the story frame. Honestly, I don't care. Go Britt and Merlin! ;-)END SPOILERS********SO! Overall, I loved it, and I recommend it.

Obviously this is a book for beginners in Photoshop CC. Different than most other publications of this nature, it does not try to cram pages full of information into the confused mind of the Photoshop CC rookie. Instead, the authors (the Adobe Photoshop product experts) follow that old Chinese proverb, &#8220;Tell me and I&#8217;ll forget, show me and I may remember, involve me and I&#8217;ll learn.&#8221; And involve you they will. The book (in fact all books in this series) is built on the premise that you, the reader, are just like any other student in a classroom. There are 14 sections to this book and the reader downloads 14 lesson files onto his/her computer, one for each section. Then the text takes the reader on a journey through Photoshop CC using the book text and the downloaded lesson files to cover all of the salient points of the subject at hand. Thus the reader (student) is using the same processes and strokes on his/her computer that the book is illustrating. Hence, the portion of the proverb that states, &#8220;Involve me and I&#8217;ll learn&#8217; is being truly followed.The manner in which the text is presented in the book also is calculated to foster learning at a reasoned pace. The steps to be followed are not jammed together but, rather, nicely physically spaced apart so that the student is not overwhelmed by an avalanche of instruction and information. This is the kinder and gentler side alluded to previously. The instruction given is well illustrated. The student is not left floundering wondering where or what to do next. All instructions and information are presented in simple, easy to understand language.The lesson sections begin with a familiarization of the Photoshop CC work area and then move into basic photo correction techniques. From here the student is taken deeper into Photoshop processes finally arriving at the point all photographers aim for, the printing of the picture. This is followed by a very useful Appendix which shows the Photoshop CC Tools Panel and also includes a small picture depicting what each of these tools are used for in the program. These 4 pages alone are almost worth the cost of the book. In my early flights into Photoshop&#8217;s mysteries, I would have given much to have these pages before me as I struggled to learn this program. Additionally, each section has some Review Questions at the end of the section to reinforce understanding of the subject matter. Also, in some cases &#8216;Extra Credit&#8217; projects are given to allow the students to apply their learning and explore the information just ingested in a new direction. Kind of like trying out your wings while still in the nest.The book is 390 pares in length, soft covered and easy to read. Contents and Index pages make it easy to find a particular subject when needed. One might question whether or not a book can cover all that Photoshop has to offer in 390 pages. My answer to that question would be definitely not. But what it will do is provide a reasonable ability to navigate the deep waters of Photoshop, particularly for Beginners in the program. To me, trying to stuff all of Photoshop at once into the Beginner&#8217;s brain would leave you with a very frustrated individual. I say that as a student that tried to learn Photoshop a number of years ago, became frustrated by its&#8217; complexity and let it go for several years. As stated previously, the kinder and gentler approach adopted by Adobe in this book will produce a student who is well equipped to use Photoshop quite expertly minus any hint of frustration. At that level and frame of mind, the student will be quite able to grasp the more esoteric and lesser used functions of the program as the experience level grows.As of the writing of this review, Adobe Photoshop CC Classroom in a Book sells for $40.19 on Amazon.com. There is also a Kindle Edition available for $24. If you are a Beginner trying to climb the Photoshop CC mountain, this book is probably the best guide to get you to the top. Will it teach you everything you need to know about this program? No it will not. However, upon faithful and successful completion of the material in this book you will be miles ahead of those that strike out on their own and choose the thickest and heaviest book on the subject that they can find. You will also be ahead of those that choose the &#8216;just give the strokes to use&#8217; approach for the simple reason that you will have learned by deep involvement.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The book for Beginners", "unixReviewTime": 1390003200, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2014"}

I laughed, I hurt, I rejoiced, I panted, and I yelled because the author has the ability to make you feel exactly what the characters are going through as though you are IN the story.  I did not want to put this book down once I started.Ronin and Amery are a great couple.  You could easily sense their attraction and though neither of them are perfect (how boring would that be?) you wanted them to be together. To figure out how to make it work.  Amery was bold and adventurous and Ronin stayed a bit of a mystery throughout the book (for good reason).  We learned bits and pieces of him, just enough to make him interestingly Alpha and definitely sexy.I read a lot of books in this genre and I have to give Lorelei James credit for a unique and refreshing story line involving Japanese rope bondage.  If you have read other books by other authors in this genre, you will be surprised at how much more of a story you will get with Bound, along with the heat, and there is a lot of heat.  However, I never felt like the sex or bondage overpowered the love story.  The emotionalism and eroticism combined made into beautifully written scenes.I loved this book on so many levels and I hope there will be plenty more to the series.  There certainly are enough supporting characters to keep it going.SPOILER****A note about the cliffhanger - Normally, I am not a fan of cliffhangers.  But here's the thing.

Oh, but then there are the stories in Sunday School too! We hear of David and Goliath, the conquest of Canaan, and the sack of Jerusalem. In truth, tales of war are foreign to our very makeup. If we haven&#8217;t served in the armed forces, we cannot really appreciate all that goes into fighiting for one&#8217;s land and the sacrifice and honor it brings.Warfare was a fact of life in the ancient Near East (ANE), and Bible characters, like everyone else, were affected by the ebb and flow of the seasons, and &#8220;the time when kings go out to battle&#8221; (2 Sam. 11:1). The Bible is written in this context of ANE warfare and assumes we know what chariots and javelins are, and why it is that a people would want a king to &#8220;go out before us and fight our battles&#8221; (1 Sam. 8:20). (Chariots, by the way, were less like tanks and more like mobile platforms for archers.)Boyd Seevers gives us a tool in understanding the concept of war in ANE history with his new book &#34;Warfare in the Old Testament: The Organization, Weapons, and Tactics of Ancient Near Eastern Armies.&#34; In this accessible and attractive volume, he itemizes the implements and tools for war as found in the dominant cultures represented in the Old Testament: Philistia, Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, and of course, Israel.Strategy, history, numbers and weapons, boats and chariots, siege engines, and armor &#8212; all these and more are described in the detail a bible geek or armchair archeologist-historian will love. Maps, drawings, diagrams and sketches fill the pages like a technical manual. Interesting facts are highlighted, like the difficulties with the Hebrew number system, the fact that Akkadian was a lingua franca as far back as the fourteenth century BC, and Persia&#8217;s invention of the first true &#8220;pony express.&#8221;Seevers doesn&#8217;t just present dry historical facts ad nauseum, however. He offers fictional vignettes of typical soldiers on a campaign before each discussion of the military history of a given culture. This draws the reader in and adds the tool of imagination which helps flesh out the incomplete picture that too often emerges after the archeological digs are done sifting through what remains we have left. His style is inviting, even if at times his rigid arrangement of the material comes off somewhat wooden.This book will help situate the student of OT history, and will make a good addition to any scholar&#8217;s library. It may interest the casual reader, but it may not. The laser focus of the material will not appeal to everyone, but for those who are interested, Seevers leaves few stones unturned.Disclaimer:This book was provided by Kregel Publications.

Hot guys (yes there are multiple)....absolutely.  Love triangle....yep.  All of that rolled into one book equals &#34;Tag Chaser&#34; by Kandi Steiner.  Paisley doesn't let very many people in...in fact she can count the people close to her on two fingers and one of them is her very hot guy best friend Tanner.  After being hurt in the past she decides to date only military men because they eventually leave and she can move on with no commitment needed.  When her other best friend Mackenzie makes her bet that she can't give up her &#34;tag chasing&#34; ways and date a regular guy, Paisley rises to the challenge and decides that it's time for a change.  Enter Corbin Ray, a guy who makes her reevaluate all the walls she keeps around herself.  Will the secrets they are each keeping from one another threaten the relationship they are building?  When Paisley has to choose between the two guys fighting for her heart will she choose the easy path or the one that challenges her to be more than she ever thought she could be?  Click buy now and find out as you sink your teeth into the pages of this moving and sexy story!I love Tanner!  I may be in the minority here but he just hit all the right notes for me!  He is sexy, just the right amount of cocky, and willing to do anything for Paisley.  I love that he is so into music and I really identified with him seeing his life through lyrics.  Every girl should have a Tanner waiting on them at home and I was seriously jealous of Paisley and frustrated at her inability to see what was right in front of her.  The second book in this series focuses on Tanner and I couldn't pick it up fast enough as soon as I finished this one.Paisley is really like a little girl lost.  Disappointed by her dad, she has lost her faith in the male species (with the exception of Tanner).  She's a bit like a shell of a person just going through the motions of life hoping nothing will penetrate the thick walls she surrounds herself in.  I love her banter with Tanner...they have a natural connection that flows effortlessly off the page.  The attraction and the chemistry are there as well which makes the love triangle all that much more realistic when you throw Corbin into the mix.  I liked watching her journey of self-discovery brought on by her growing relationship with Corbin.  It was cool seeing her find herself as she found him.Corbin is just as hot as Tanner and an all around great guy.  I like that Steiner doesn't make either guy a jerk but instead allows you to invest in each one differently.  He, too, has suffered hurt in the past and is coming into himself along with Paisley.  They bring about healing in each other and it gives their story a nice quiet beauty.Steiner's style is very fluid.  She chooses to focus on the heart of her characters and that makes them all the more realistic.  Her character development is spot on and sets up these characters to move on past one book.  I am fully invested in this series and am already halfway through book two.  I can't wait to see where these character's roads lead.  This is a definite one to recommend.  Great job Kandi Steiner!*I was given a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.*Shannon, My Secret Book Spot", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "GREAT JOB Kandi Steiner!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1403827200, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2014"}

So, you know I had to freakin' read it then.  Well, in some aspects it mirrors the BDB, and others it does not.  I think these guys are every bit of alpha that the BDB is, but they seem to have this flare, this humor about them that sets them apart.  As the BDB has it's own world of good and evil, so do the Protectors.  I loved this book for two reason. 1.) Damon is all VC Warrior and goes alpha as the need arises, but he can also poke fun of himself at the drop of a hat. And 2.) Nicole is this little bada** with a purpose and even though she's like 5 foot nothing, she grabs the bull by the horns and pisses him off more!  That being said, they both have a lot to learn about each other and I'm glad I took this ride with them.Damon (The decapitator!), well at first seems to have a chip on his shoulders for some reason and he sure as hell doesn't seems to be doing anything to dislodge it.  Until... he meets this tough little human.  Not to say she dislodged it, but she made him think twice about it!  I wanted to beat his butt for walking away from Nicole when she bared her soul to him.  I mean, you think she was devastated, you should have seen how many tissues and chocolate I went through over that!  Damn you DeMasters!!  Now our petite lovely, hard-hitting human Nicole, well, she won my heart in the first chapter.  She gets a black eye on the job and shrugs it off to a &#34;day at the office&#34;  I love that woman!  She's all kinds of hilarious, but takes her job and the children she protects very seriously!  She came from the same side of the tracks as most of the kids she saves and protects, so in essence, she's  saving herself every time she pulls another kid off the streets or out of a bad situation.  I found it comical that she has a swear jar and enforces it... hard!  I'd be dropping a $20 in that bad boy at the start of every week!Great supporting characters in Pam, Jared, and that crabby boss of hers Mitch!  I laughed out loud more times than I can count.  I can't wait to sink my fangs... I mean teeth into Jared's book... something tells me he's going to be funnier and hotter than Damon... Maybe!!  I even liked that POS Chad.  He made for a great &#34;bad guy&#34; and those beotches who come into feed the Vamps... what did the author call them... &#34;walking blood bank&#34; sheesh, I never wanted to beat someone's butt more so than when that Vicki had her talk with Nicole!To wrap this up, I'd have to say The Protectors are being added to my new favorite vamps category and I'll tell anyone who will listen about them.  This was 286 (Kindle Version) pages long and a nice quick read if you're left undisturbed by your friends and family!!  It has hot uber alpha male sex, unbelievably cute female banter, and some of the funniest stuff I've read in a long time.  The dialogue flows very nicely and I found myself blazing right through it.  The pacing is excellent and the angst leading up to that remarkable climax kept me enthralled for hours.5 Stars!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "THIS HUMAN WANTS TO BE DAMON'S MATE!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1396742400, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2014"}

This book had me laughing my head off. Lucy Percy is an heiress and has just come off a betrothal gone awry once her discerning uncle helps her face up to the fact that the gentleman she was engaged to, wanted her only for her money.  Lucy wants to get away from fortune hunters and rusticate for a few months, so she and her widowed aunt decide to rent a cottage in the country. During their time there, the two ladies agree that Lucy will pose as a widow.They rent their cottage from the local Lord, Avedon, who has just managed to get rid of a former renter - a young lady with several children - who was trying to take advantage of his young nephew.  Thinking his nephew will be safe with two widows coming to live in the cottage, he is flummoxed to realize one of the \"widows\" is a young, comely Lucy.Nothing will do Avedon but to get rid of the new tenants - but... Lucy is not easy to get rid of.  All the while, his nephew falls for Lucy and makes a cake of himself, Avedon plunges on in his efforts to get rid of the tenants even going so far as to tear up the road making it impossible for Lucy and her aunt to go or come from the cottage.  Avedon is not prepared for the stubborness he finds in Lucy - she will not leave and the harder he tries to get rid of them, the more determined she is to stay in the cottage.When an additional relative - the somewhat older but still very eligible, handsome, cousin Morton comes into the picture, it seems Avedon begins to realize that he might not want Lucy to leave after all.  But, he still doesn't know what to make of Lucy and first decides that she is not \"as good as she ought to be\" and on a lovely trip to the ocean to one of his properties, offers her carte blanche.  Oh boy, this is where things really get going.  She takes his curricle and heads back home leaving him to make his way back via a borrowed nag and a donkey cart.Once Avedon has realized his mistake, he is done for - at least until he can make a few more mistakes.  During the meantime, his cousin, Morton, is having the time of his life seeing the stiff, conservative Avedon make a \"mud\" cake of himself.  My favorite scene is when Avedon and Bigelow head off to \"rescue\" Lucy from Morton when she is visiting her uncle.  At this point, I was hiding in the bathroom laughing my head off while my husband was sleeping, hoping I wasn't waking him up.Funny, funny book.

The Dominant, the same story as the The Submissive, told from Nathaniel's perspective gave me hope for the rapidly more popular genre.I appreciated getting a look inside Nathaniel's head. I love the idea of a multi perspective story. From his side, he admits he made some royally dick moves that weren't necessarily clear in the first book. I liked getting to hear the story of his mentor and the good verbal slaps he bestowed. I also like how the author, in the voice of Todd, shoots down the idea that because he had a childhood trauma, he's into BDSM. As for the BDSM itself, it seemed fairly tame. The focus was definitely on the D & S, less on the B, and a largely non-existent M (though my interpretation of masochism is more than having a riding crop smacked on your cooch). It's refreshing to see both sides of the relationship and evening out the narrator bias.I bump it down a star because Nathaniel could go a tad over the top sometimes. I thought the &#34;kid trying to ask his date to the prom&#34; analogy was appropriate more than once. I see where she was going with the guy who had never understood love before grappling with his emotions, but the emotions seemed to win a little too frequently.

The points that grabbed me most were the references to the achievements of Steve Jobs, Henry Ford, the Wright brothers who were so consumed by their desires that it did not seem crazy to take the chances they took.

With the prospect of a new job, Phillip is all too eager to move to a new state to work in a town filled with all types of shifters. What Phillip didn&#8217;t expect, though, was the wolf shifter who just so happens to be his future sexy boss, Dr. Gunner Samuels. Phillip feels more than just lust when it comes to the hunky wolf and in an attempt to push the two together, Phillip&#8217;s best friend invites the boss over for a dinner that Phillip has to cook. There&#8217;s just two problems, Phillip doesn&#8217;t know how to cook&#8230; and he&#8217;s a vegetarian.I loved that this story is filled with so many clever one-liners. It had me chuckling often because of the mix of humor and funny animal characteristics. As a wolf, Gunner can&#8217;t help but sniff Phillip and as a chipmunk, Phillip can&#8217;t help but hoard nuts and other foods. It was a good mix of cute and funny that kept a smile on my face throughout the story.With those little attributes, I found the characters very endearing. I just loved Phillip&#8217;s stammering over talking to Gunner about anything not related to work but I also loved that Gunner found so much amusement in Phillip&#8217;s awkwardness.

As it is, I didn&#8217;t exactly feel the love that the characters claimed to have. There were also some moments that I would have loved to see instead of being told about.All in all, an adorably funny story about a chipmunk and a wolf who just happen to work together.

This had happened near a remote island off the southwest coast of New Guinea, deep in the Pacific Ocean. What was reported in the newspapers at the time is that his friend chose to wait on floating debris and was rescued, but Michael chose to try to swim the five miles to the island in question, in a rather desperate personal search for primitive artifacts for his museum featuring items form the Asmat people. The Asmat tribe was a small group of pre-stone Age people, having little or no contact with the outside world.At first it seemed it would just be a matter of days before Michael would be found and reported alive -- after all he was a Rockefeller. But as the time stretched out, the chances that he would be discovered at all, dimmed. The conventional wisdom had it that undoubtedly he had drown. And then the reports petered out altogether ...Over the years, intermittent reports trickled-in but became more and more speculative and more and more macabre, until there were only a rash of unconfirmed reports of a death due to cannibalism? Those reports were received with equal measures of tantalizing shock and incredulity; and as often as not, were dismissed.Now with this book, it seems that after nearly 50 years, we do finally get the full story of what happened to him. And if this story can be trusted, and I believe many parts of it can, it is indeed a story worthy of the long wait.Apparently,  Michael did not drown as many had speculated, but did indeed manage to swim to the Dutch island in question safely. Only to then be quickly captured, summarily executed and &#34;ceremoniously cooked&#34; and eaten by a local Armat tribe, apparently still in search of revenge for an earlier attack by the guns of white men who had shot and killed several of them three years before. Thus, the story reported here is that Michael was a victim of tribal revenge due to the earlier shooting.It is based on research and interviews of tribesmen and a careful study of documents and other forensic artifacts, and does go into great detail about the ritual of cannibalism -- so much so that a prudent reader might leave the book as I did, thinking that the author had a particular cannibalism fetish? Or at the very least, will leave one with the idea that he had an undue fascination with the tribal ritual of cannibalism?That part of the story actually gave me the creeps because it reminded me of a book I had read about six months ago about the revolution in Indonesia, a war that was taking place around the same time as the search for Michael's disappearance was still in full force. As is the case in this book, in that book too, Western reporters seemed to &#34;zero-in&#34; on the several claims of cannibalism on both sides of that conflict -- to the complete exclusion of the war itself!But in that case, it turned out (rather disappointingly for the cannibalistic thrill-seeking reporters), that the &#34;so-called&#34; incidences of cannibalism, were in fact staged symbolic chest-beating acts of war: mutual mockery of the adversary. A symbolic bite was taken out of the head of the adversary as part of their warrior victory dance.However, as this author reports it here, it is cannibalism in the flesh (excuse the horrible pun), that is, cannibalism &#34;for real,&#34; conducted as a purification ritual that is intended to endow &#34;the consumer&#34; with the best qualities of the head of &#34;those consumed.&#34;But here is this book's &#34;kicker:&#34; the fact that Michael Rockefeller may have been killed and eaten by a primitive tribe, is not the worse part of this story. That distinction must must be reserved for the cowardly Dutch government, which for decades knew the truth. However, since at the time they were the custodians of the islands in question, they were simply too embarrassed, to busy in a global CYA exercise that failed to report the truth of Michael's death.This book is an interesting read for those who want the author's speculative theories about why Michael was obsessed with collecting the art of primitive tribes, and thus about why he was willing to take the risky chance of swimming five miles to a remote island after his catamaran had collapsed. Although I found the story about what happened to Michael credible, I found the book itself altogether a bit to &#34;campy,&#34; too much &#34;inside Harvard baseball&#34; and not enough compassion for Michael's death or hard cold analysis of the facts.

They have been prayed up to seven times a day, decade in and decade out, by hundreds of millions of individuals in both traditions.  Sadly, however, for all sorts of reasons, the Psalms have completely or all but disappeared from the liturgy and personal prayer of many in the Christian community.  N. T. Wright, lifelong New Testament scholar and retired bishop in the Anglican church, sets out in this short book why he thinks the loss of the Psalms in liturgy is a &#8220;great impoverishment.&#8221;  He even goes further in saying that ignoring the Psalms is &#8220;bluntly crazy.&#8221;  (location 53) I agree with him wholeheartedly.This is not a scholarly book, just a very well-written one that comes straight from his heart.  Wright wrote this short book for several reasons; he makes his case passionately, and puts it in terms lay people can understand.  First, he wants to reverse the trend toward the neglect or even the elimination of the Psalms in churches' and people's lives.  Secondly, he wanted to take a look at what the Psalms are, while conveying what they do to him when he sings or prays them, which he's been doing since he was seven years old.  But third, he also wanted to look at them from the perspective of second temple Judaism to understand how devout Jews in Jesus' day prayed and looked at the Psalms.There is, of course, a bit of history here and there, but only to make those other matters intelligible.  Jesus, Wright notes, preached a &#8220;Psalm-soaked gospel&#8221; based on a very different worldview than the one many of us live by, even those of us who call ourselves Christians.  They were important to Jesus, and should be important to us:Part of my reflection in this book is that when the Psalms do their work in us andthrough us, they should equip us the better to live by and promote that alternativeworldview. (203)Wright organized the main part of the book based on what he called a &#8220;thought experiment&#8221; that the Psalms have always invited their singers and pray-ers (by that I mean to convey &#8220;people who are praying&#8221; rather than what they are saying) to live at the crossroads of time, space, and matter.  I won't try to explain exactly what he means by that, but I think it was a very good organizing principle.  I am no specialist but also not a novice to the Psalms, but the device helped me to look at them in fresh ways.  Wright works through this device by looking at many of the Psalms, both individually and as they relate to each other.  He covered several of my favorite Psalms, but I think after reading this book for the first time, I have a couple more favorites to add to that list.I won't say he saved the best for last, but the last chapter and the afterward are no mere add-ons.  &#8220;At Home in the Psalms&#8221; covers what he sees as neglect of the Psalms, and why he thinks they should be used more in churches, both in singing and in spoken prayer.  He also makes the case for regular reading through all the Psalms as a regular discipline.  In the afterward, &#8220;My Life with the Psalms&#8221; Wright relates how he uses the Psalms in his own prayer life, and the place particular Psalms have had in his life, both his prayer life and in his life of faith and community.I am not an Anglican myself, but I love reading N. T. Wright, and a week does not go by that I don't listen to or watch one or usually more of his lectures or snippets from interviews with him on the internet.  I love this book in particular because the Psalms have been so important in my own pilgrimage, and I wish more Christians would avail themselves of this bottomless well of spiritual strength.Wright call us not first and foremost to study the Psalms&#8212;though he is all in favor of that too&#8212;but more importantly to pray them and live them.

I wasn't crazy about Young's books after that book, but I really wanted to know what happened to Hannah so I jumped on this one.We're reintroduced to Hannah as a young woman and she's now a high-school teacher and sidelines as a volunteer for an adult literacy program. It seems she isn't quite as content as she was when we last saw her. She doesn't date (and hasn't much interest in it), works hard and most of her fulfillment comes from her job and her friendship with her best friend Cole (remember Cole, Jo's brother? He's all grown up and he grew up hot. Oh god, that sounds so creepy. Forget I said that.)Hannah's lack of contentment seems to stem from her relationship with Marco and we get details of this when she discovers her old diaries detailing their sweet but turbulent teenage friendship. And while she's in the middle of this nostalgia haze, who does she bump into? Yup, Marco. And he wants to, um, reconnect.I enjoyed this book much much more than Young's previous books. It was sweet with a gentle pace. There was some on-the-nose 'difficult students vs inspirational teacher' stuff that wasn't all that necessary, but it gave us a nice insight into Hannah's kind nature. Marco was a persistent and enigmatic hero, but he did anger me off on occasion (but not enough to put me off the book).One issue I did have with the book was the sheer volume of characters. If you're a fan of this series, don't worry, your favourites almost certainly make an appearance, along with various children, wives, husbands, boyfriends, etc. It's nice for die-hard fans, but so much of it was unnecessary.

Will history repeat itself with his brother-in-law&#8217;s new wife?As soon as I read the blurb for this novella, I couldn&#8217;t wait to find out more. The science fiction themes are strong, but the character development is even more pronounced. While it took me a little while to get to know all of the characters well, I was surprised by how much I figured out about them once the plot was given a chance to simmer. This is the kind of tale that requires some investment early on, but every ounce of effort poured into understanding what is happening was richly rewarded for this reader.The first few scenes were somewhat confusing for me due to the number of characters who were being introduced at the same time that so many inexplicable things are happening. The pacing in the remainder of the plot was even, but I did find it a little too fast in the beginning due to how much the author expects his audience to figure out in an extremely short amount of time.With that being said, I am a big fan of stories like this one that require you to think. Mr. Maus knows how to strike that delicate balance between explaining what on earth just happened and giving the reader a chance use his or her own mind to pull together the most subtle clues. It is this ability of his that makes me quite curious to see what he will come up with next.Machines of the Little People is a complicated, thought-provoking, intelligent ride that I didn&#8217;t want to end. It&#8217;s long enough to cover all of the bases, but short enough to read in one sitting for dedicated science fiction fans.

Some parts were good, which kept me reading to the end.  Others were disjointed and characters slipped out of... well, character.I read true accounts of families like this, so I can see how unhealthy the home lives of the children can be, with parents obsessed with helping others. Not just helping others, but performing what are essentially exorcisms.  To collect the &#34;haunted&#34; objects is creepy, but not scary, just weird.  Especially the doll.  I would have burned it!Sylvie does not act like the intelligent girl we are led to believe she is.  She is not a little girl, she is 14.  Old enough to tell the truth.  Old enough to stand up to her sister.  Old enough to speak up and say, &#34;We have no food in the house.&#34;  I can only figure she ate school lunches, or she would have literally starved!  Even when the book goes back in time, Sylvie is not a little girl.  So, no way would the &#34;good girl&#34; cover for her sister.  That scene with Dot was over the top ridiculous!  Not the least bit believable that 1) it would happen 2) Sylvie wouldn't tell 3) Dot would keep quiet!Is Rose (daughter Rose) a victim of her upbringing? Is she acting out?  I don't think so.  She sounds like a sociopath.  Perhaps that is what the author intended, but I got the idea we were supposed to blame the parents, particularly the father.  At what point did she go &#34;bad?&#34;  Before she was sent away for lesbian tendencies, that's clear.  That was a surprise, finding out the &#34;school&#34; she was sent to was to reprogram her to &#34;Biblical thinking,&#34; and not for her poor behavior.

The root of the series is about 4 McKay brothers and their families. Their children are who the books are about along with plenty of background on the 4 families. The McKay&#8217;s made their living as ranchers and most of their children went on to also become ranchers but some also were rodeo stars and others in various jobs from construction to law enforcement.The series evolves over a lot of world building (even though this word is typically used with science fiction I feel it pertinent here).  Sometimes the first book in a series can be overloaded with backstories and characters as you are introduced to it. LHR really didn&#8217;t really do that. It was the books that preceded it that got to the heart of the Mckay family and all the things you come to love about the series with each book. LHR was a look at life on the road for Colby McKay who was a bull rider and calf roper. Colby traveled the circuit with Trevor and Edgard and the three of them in between shows were never short on women. When they run into Channing Kinkaid on the road and she wants to join them on the road and agrees to be their personal buckle bunny things start changing in the relationships between all of them.I didn&#8217;t really like Colby through most of this book. Its funny in every book after this one I did but in this one he was a bit too arrogant and he needed to be brought down a peg or two.This wasn&#8217;t the first book I read in the series when I started. I happened to find this author right after she released the second book in the series and I loved that book so then came back and read the first one.

These flaws will prove, throughout this read, to be the factors that placed Dr. Rush forever on the 2nd tier of Founders. It is NOT that Rush was not an extraordinary man, he was, it may be rather that the 'Pantheon' tier of the Founders (Washington, Madison, Jefferson, Franklin, Hamilton and Adams) left contributions that have been judged for over two centuries to be not only extraordinary, but heroic. To the contrary, Rush's place in history (for the purpose of this book) is judged principally as an essayist, polemicist & revolutionary. In this context, Author Brodsky succeeds, perhaps unintentionally (?) in portraying Rush as notable in history principaly through his 'connections' with the Great Men of the Revolution rather than through his own accomplishments; a \"Revolutionary Gadfly\": the title given by earlier biographer David Freeman Hawke (Benjamin Rush: Revolutionary Gadfly).Rush was trained in Philadelphia and Edinburgh as a physician. He achieved eminence in his profession, served in the 1st & 2nd Continental Congress, was 'Patron' for Thomas Paine, signed the Declaration of Independence (though played no part in it's formulation), served as a Surgeon General for the Continental Army, conspired to remove Washington as Commander-in-Chief (Rush's  'undoing') worked for ratification of the Constitution, and most famously, 'healed' the late-life rift between Adams and Jefferson (see Zarrow's,Friendship and Healing: The Dreams of John Adams and Benjamin Rush). Rush leaves behind a full resum&eacute;, acting at the center of medicine, but only on the periphery of politics and in both often flawed by, \"impetuousness and...indiscretion.\"The book's author, the late (April 12, 2011) Alyn Brodsky, delivers an even handed account of his subject written clearly and interestingly; only occasionally tipping the playing field in favor of Rush and then with military assessments who's victors are at least arguable and still questioned (Gates at Saratoga and Allen at Ticonderoga; see Randall'sBenedict Arnold: Patriot and Traitor).  Rush's ability to judge military leadership is summed by the selection of his favorite generals: Horatio Gates, Charles Lee and Thomas Conway; all three eventually disgraced. Brodsky struggles with Rush's story; the politics, often sniping and vindictive, are not enough to fill a volume; the medical seems unconnected - always primitive, frequently harmful and all to often tangential to the story of the Founding. If there is a (minor) criticism of the author's style, it is that the read is occasionally overly 'punctuated' with primary source material which brings to the story, in many instances, more cobwebs than clarification. The latter chapters struggle to give Rush a meaningful role in political events and go by s-l-o-w-l-y. Brodsky was interviewed by Brian Lamb on C-SPAN, Booknotes in 2009. That video (~58-min) is still available on their web site and worth watching prior to the read. I cautiously recommend this book to history buffs; it flows easily and provides a unique perspective to the events of the Revolution and Founding Period that the reader does not get to see when portrayed (typically) through  the experiences of the  'pantheon' founders. By the end, the book comes up well short of establishing Rush as an indispensable Founder and leaves the reader questioning the criterion for 18th century medical efficacy.-----kindle edition-----Well done!

End of the world tales are fascinating and I constantly find myself asking, &#34;What would I do&#34;?  Some of the books published in this genre can be a bit corny or too confusing but there are some that are simple, realistic, and develop great characters.  Thankfully, this book does just that.  &#34;The Remaining&#34; is a story about a soldier who is ordered to go into an underground bunker at various times when things get a little &#34;crazy&#34;.  He is a part of a government program in which soldiers are spread throughout the United States and who do the same thing.  In the event that the government should collapse, these soldiers are tasked with rebuilding America.  Usually, the soldiers are put into these bunkers only for a short time while some crisis works itself out...but not this time.  Something known as &#34;Fury&#34; has spread throughout the world and it has driven people crazy.  This &#34;madness&#34; like virus doesn't turn people into zombies but it sure is just as scary.  It is kind of like human rabies.  The main character then goes through the process of dealing with infected people, warlords, and bandits.  His main goal is to try to find good people and assist them into banding together in an attempt to bring order, structure, and basically the government back.We've seen and read books like this before.  Zombies, human rabies, other &#34;crazy&#34; viruses...I mean there are hundreds of these books that you can find on Amazon.  What really makes this one stand out is it's believability and I especially like the concept that the main character actually has a mission.  It isn't a story about a guy with a military background that just wants to be left alone and survive...this character actually is trying to get involved and do something that will help.  The book moves very fast and I couldn't stop reading it.  It isn't laden down with a bunch of military lingo and long descriptions of gear.  It gives you the essential information that you need and moves the story on.  The main character isn't a superhero either.  There were several times while I was reading that I would slap my forehead and scream at the pages of the book as the character proceeds in a way that I didn't think was best.  He makes some mistakes, is under the stress of the situation, and it makes for some very believable reading.  The main character is very skilled for this mission, but things don't always turn out for the best.  This, of course, is what makes this book apocalyptic magic in your hands.  The author really knows how to move you through the development of the situation, characters, and their ongoing conflict.  There are plenty of decisions that have to made and it fun to see what choices the character follows through with.The book also has some extras too.  There is a short story included that tells the tale of a couple that are trying to survive the outbreak and make it to a FEMA camp.  As they are loading onto the buses, all hell breaks loose.  It is a great short story that ties into the main novel very well.  You are also given a few chapters for the next book as well.  The introductory price for this novel is a great reason for you to try this story out.  If your a fan of this genre and looking for a great read...I highly recommend this one!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the best in this genre!", "unixReviewTime": 1403222400, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2014"}

While an enjoyable read this book didn&#8217;t quite draw me in and keep me engrossed as her McKettrick, Stone Creek or Montana Creed series have. Part of it could have been the secrets that Kendra was keeping that were never divulged or the lack of family ties and history that the characters had. But like her other books Big Sky Country is set in a small town in the West with a few cowboys/ranchers thrown in. The character development was slow at times. Joslyn and Slade had chemistry that they tried to fight throughout the story but eventually they gave in to it and the sparks did fly. The romance was slow to materialize and it seemed unrealistic that in such a small town that they could avoid each other as long as they did once their romance ignited. It was fun to watch the give and take between Hutch and Slade and to see the positive turn their relationship took by the end of the story. Shea was a nice addition to the storyline and you could feel her vulnerability shine through but most of the time she was a typical teen who wanted to be a part of things and be loved and often spoke without thinking. The descriptions of the Montana scenery was breathtaking in parts and made you feel that you were there. I look forward to reading the other books in the series and getting deeper and more involved in the lives of those that live in Parable.Favorite Quote: &#8230;and if she hadn&#8217;t known it earlier when he kissed her, she knew for sure now.

I was concerned by the overly cute illustrations on the cover. I thought I was going to be reading something over the top cheezy and not relevant to today's woman.

Heather sees it as a mystery. Abby discovers delicious dashes of Jane Austen. Lia sees in it the idealism of a bygone day. And Molly just wishes they'd made the book into a movie!One by one, each of the women finds romantic love&#8212;often in spite of the historic book&#8217;s advice. And in searching for the legendary gold, the friends discover the best kind of treasure. The kind that brings hope and healing to each of their hearts.I am glad that I decided to look beyond the cute cover though if you look close you will see elements of the story in these illustrations.

I just think it is gonna be impossible for me to adore any of the couples like J&M.;  I'm biased.So Cole and Viv have been doing the semi-friends with benefits for 2 years now and just as he's coming to terms with maybe wanting more outside the bedroom, she is tired of his bs and him making her look like the idiot she isn't.  I gotta say Cole pissed me off plenty (listening to the loser band manager, buying into his own hype, not seeing Viv for the amazing woman she would become sooner) for at least half this book but then he turned around and not only pulled his head out of his rear but began to use his brain to see the big picture with the band as well as the girl.  He then decided to take some action.  Yay!While Cole is getting it together, Viv is trying to make sense of the draw she has to him.  It makes her feel stupid which I can't blame her.  She hasn't been with anyone since their SFWB started (not happy about that actually). So she finally gets a great job and things go on from there...Loved how the band's drama was incorporated into this.

She is the woman all men want to date and have in their bed, but as much as her reputation may look like she is an easy lay, Riley as far from it. In fact she has a secret that is hard to believe, all her articles and sex talk is not based on personal experience.So when her editor request that each one of them write something personal for Stiletto&#8217;s anniversary issue, Riley needs help from the one man she has always been able to count on and asks for the biggest favor ever.Sam Compton will do anything for Riley, except be her experimental sex toy. He flat out refuses to be used by her in that way, but when she starts shopping around for another man to take his place he finds himself unable to accept that.Sam and Riley have been best friends for a long time and love to give each other a hard time when it comes to their dating lives. Riley leaves things in Sam&#8217;s car and home to get him into trouble, while Sam just tends to ignore that she is dating anyone, well having sex with anyone actually. But Sam has always felt that he was not good enough for Riley. And her proposition just complicates matters to him and his feelings towards her.But with her writing about sex, how could she write all of that without having done it herself. He expects her to be an expert but the truth is far from it. And the truth behind why they date the way they do and their own sex lives is actually the very reason why they care about the what the other may be doing or whom they might be dating. Jealousy can be a strong factor in life, and unless they realize the reason behind it, neither of them will be able to have the happiness they desire.Riley has been writing about sex for ten years, she knows that to actually experience what she writes about will be no big deal, or so she thinks. Her one-night deal with Sam is so amazing it soon turns into just one more time, and another and another.Soon Riley and Sam realize that true love will not let itself be made into a one-night thing.

It's a story about so many things &#8211; love, death, betrayal, deceit, and hope. There are several story lines that are going on and Tracy does a fantastic job of weaving them all together to make for a very intriguing read.In short, the heroine Mia, learns that several vaccines her company Moncure Therapeutics formulated may have been tainted during the manufacturing process and she is set out to find the truth because hundreds are dying.

He is a little torn between his job (working for Mia&#8217;s mother who forbids any relationships between her staff and her family) and his feelings for Mia.

KaplanReviewed by Andy McKinneyRobert D. Kaplan currently works for the famed intelligence firm, Stratfor.  He acts in the capacity of chief geopolitical analyst.  He has in the past worked in the Pentagon under Secretary of Defense Robert Gates.  In his academic life he taught at the US Naval Academy at Annapolis.  He has served as a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington D.C.  He has authored some 15 books including perhaps most famously &#8220;The Revenge of Geography&#8221;.  He is considered by Foreign Policy Magazine as among the 100 Global Thinkers, a group of intellects that help to shape the fate of the world.  He knows his oats.In &#8220;Asia&#8217;s Cauldron-The South China Sea and the end of a Stable Pacific&#8221; he explains the background for the seemingly daily news reports of contention in that body of water.  The bordering nations are China in the north, Viet Nam in the West and the Philippines in the East.  Other interested countries include Malaysia and Singapore.  Tiny Brunei also has an interest in the sea.The current value of the South China Sea resides in its use as a highway for tens of thousands of passing freighters and tankers.  A very large proportion of the world&#8217;s trade sails through this body of water.  China is naturally interested in seeing the oil that fuels its economy sails unfettered to Chinese ports.  The giant container ships that take vast amounts of cargo to and from China are also of a first order of importance.Each of the bordering nations has a unique history with the sea and a specific set of claims and hopes.  Viet Nam is a large, populous nation with a very long coastline bordering the South China Sea.  Chinese and Vietnamese ships come into dangerous proximity around the disputed islands, shoals and barely visible rocks on a regular basis.  Recently a Vietnamese boat was sunk in disputed water.  As Chinese wealth grows, Chinese ability to build a bigger and more modern Navy also grows.  This fact is not lost on Viet Nam.  Viet Nam has recently acquired six modern diesel/electric submarines to be at least something of a counter weight to China&#8217;s incursions, incursions from the Vietnamese viewpoint that the Chinese view as natural as we view US ships in the Gulf of Mexico.Malaysia, an odd hodgepodge of a country, a relic of British Colonialism, also has submarines.  In Malaysia&#8217;s case the subs are two very modern French developed boats.  She has them stationed in the far North East of the country, in Sabath.  The home port of the subs is within easy sailing distance of the Spartlys.  This is no coincidence.The hapless Philippines have neither the money nor the national will to do more than protest China&#8217;s occupation of specs of dry land that are hundreds of miles from China but are within spitting distance of the Philippines.Taiwan, Brunei and even Singapore all have an interest in the area.  All of the smaller states have an interest in not gradually becoming engulfed in the behemoth to the north.  Viet Nam and the Philippines are populous nations and Viet Nam at least is growing and modernizing quickly.  But China is huge by comparison and ambitious to establish sovereignty over as much of the area as she possibly can.  And China has the military means to make its opinions felt.The USA is the only possible counter weight to Chinese naval presence.  The US Navy has visiting rights with the littoral states and visits are increasing dramatically.We might expect Kaplan, an academic and a scholar, to have a ponderous writing style, but it is not the case.  He brilliantly outlines the various contending viewpoints.  He brings us to a deeper and broader understanding of the national histories and the national cultures of the contending nations.  He uses great minds from ancient Greece to modern Singapore to flesh out the grander principles involved.But at the end of the day the contention is about resources.  20% of commercial fish landings worldwide happen in the contested sea.  There is some oil and natural gas beneath its waters and littoral nations hope for more.  It is one of great seaways of the world, and one that China depends upon.  And China is swiftly building the means to overawe the other smaller, poorer and definitely less powerful bordering countries.&#8220;Asia&#8217;s Cauldron&#8221; by Robert D. Kaplan finishes not with a prediction but rather with a range of possible outcomes.  Readers with an interest in world affairs will find their knowledge base strengthened.

As a zombie fan lover who is ready for the zombie apocalypse, this book was definitely right up my alley. Considering it features some of my favorite authors, it was a no brainer that I was going to be reading it.Guess Who's Coming At Dinner by Ethan Day and Geoffrey Knight&#34;But this is what people had to do post-PTA. They started mending relationships, putting aside petty squabbles, and living in larger groups, because everybody knows that the family who hoards and boards together remains uninfected by the undead together.&#34;I absolutely love Ethan and Geoffrey and that quote is a stunning example of why. They have such wonderful senses of humor that I'm constantly kept laughing. Their story is about Chandler, a nineteen-year-old young man, and Zane, his zombie boyfriend. Just to be clear, Zane wasn't a zombie when they met. Oh no. Zane was a regular high school kid in the same class as Chandler, although in Chandler's eyes there wasn't anything &#34;regular&#34; about gorgeous, muscled, quarterback Zane. And there definitely wasn't anything remotely normal about Zane when the PTA (Pandemic Transviral Apocalypse) occurred.Nobody really knows what started the PTA, although it became known as Beefcake Fever on account of it starting at Beefcake Bob's, the fast food restaurant where Chandler worked. Chandler's best friend, Dong, was showing him a video of killer cows in China the same day their entire world fell apart, so it stood to reason that tainted beef was responsible. On his way home from school that fateful day, Chandler sees Zane, looking like death warmed over (pun totally intended), and in a moment of fate, Zane saves Chandler from being run over by an ambulance.So, Chandler takes the soon-to-be zombie to the hospital and has to leave him. In the coming months researchers speculate on many things, one being that anyone infected while they were madly (HA!) in love, seem to be able to reject the symptoms of the disease, if not the disease itself. I was wondering how the authors were going to get around the whole &#34;I want to eat your brains&#34; thing.How Zane comes to be with Chandler and his completely insane family, I'm not telling. You have to read the book to get the details. But Zane remembers Chandler when they meet again because Zane loves Chandler and that has stayed prominently in his diseased brain the whole time. This was hilariously funny and, at the same time, wonderfully tender and sweet. I absolutely loved it with all the wacky and zany humor and the sweet and gentle love that Zane and Chandler share. I totally recommend this story and it gets a big A+ from me!Surviving Sin City by Ethan Stone and Daniel A. KaineCan you imagine doing a routine pizza delivery and watching the zombie apocalypse begin, right in front of your face? That's what happens to Kaleb and he's pretty much terrified. Even worse? He goes home to find his mother has turned into a zombie. What is Las Vegas coming to?Cooper is on vacation in Las Vegas, alone, because of a fight with his partner back in England. When the news reports begin about people attacking and biting others, Cooper knows the zombie apocalypse is starting and he tries to get back to the airport so he can get home where he's prepared for this eventuality. His friends and neighbors might call him crazy, but he's stockpiled weapons and supplies for just this occurrence. When his cab driver tries to eat him, Cooper is left alone wandering blindly in an unfamiliar city until he meets Kaleb. Reluctantly pairing up with Kaleb (only for the night), Kaleb leads Cooper to an abandoned and secured bookstore where they can hide. Cooper is pretty disgusted with the Yank's ability to survive and Kaleb wonders how he got stuck with the arrogant and pissy Brit.Luckily for Cooper, Kaleb isn&#8217;t as inept as Cooper believed. Kaleb knows where to get weapons and they weren't at legitimate gun stores. So even when Cooper takes off on his own leaving Kaleb sleeping, Kaleb finds transportation and weapons before he tracks the crazy Brit down and saves him from three zombies attacking. Of course Cooper isn&#8217;t about to thank Kaleb. Sheesh! They do end up working together to take a back road on an ATV to try to get Cooper to the private airport in Henderson, and much to Cooper's relief, he and Kaleb are a great team together. Well, except for Kaleb's nosiness about what happened between Cooper and his boyfriend.You're going to have to read the book if you want to know whether they made it safely out of Vegas or if Cooper found a way back to England, leaving Kaleb to fend for himself. This story was packed full of excitement and a distinct level of gruesomeness that I reveled in. It was definitely a little more down-n-dirty than the previous story and I adored that. Great job Ethan & Daniel!Ghoul's Gym by TJ Klune and Eric ArvinThis story begins with Jake and Uly who've been together a year and just bought a home together a few months ago. Something is going on with Jake, though, and it's worrying Uly because he won't talk about it. Uly works at a gay muscle gym and he and his friends are all gigantic ripped men. Jake is tall and lanky and constantly feels like a shadow next to Uly even though Uly always tells him he loves him just as he is. The fact that Uly's boss, Stephen, is constantly hitting on him and making snide remarks about Jake, while Jake is standing there, isn't helping Jake's mental health. So, in an attempt to bulk up, Jake makes a stupid decision, without Uly's knowledge, to buy steroids. Jake tries to back out of it when he sees what this &#34;new, military grade stuff&#34; has done to some other guys, but one of them attacks him and injects him anyway. Uh-Oh.It came as no surprise that Stephen is the one providing this zombie-making drug and when Jake discovers that he heads to the gym to keep Uly safe, bringing Dusty and his Alphabet twinks who are all infected along. Meanwhile Uly is dealing with his own problems at the gym. *snort* Really, guys? The shower scene? EEEEWWWWWW! Apparently there are quite a few members who've been taking Stephen's new &#34;supplement&#34; that will make them crazy monster big. He had no idea how true that was. Poor, poor Griff. Bad idea to let the Alphabet twinks loose in the gym. HA! Okay, so it was crazy gory and I loved it. It made me think of really bad B-rated slasher films. And, yes, I'm just sick enough to have laughed. Seriously? The pool? The water polo team? Poor Thad. *grins*Jake is trying to find Uly in the midst of all this madness while simultaneously keeping the &#34;bite, tear, kill&#34; thoughts from taking over. He's doing everything he can to remember the love he shares with Uly in an attempt to retain his humanity. &#34;Even as we move, I try and find something, anything, in the recesses of my mind, something that isn't buried in rage, something that can still be my own. Something that happened the way I remembered it happening. Something about me and him. I push through all the memories, but I can't find anything free. Anything clear. Nothing.&#34;Trust my TJ and Eric to not do the predictable with the ending. Oh no. They made me cry and it was a hard cry, one that kept creeping back up on me throughout the day. The whole story was sweet, sad, funny, bloody, and heartbreaking. They also left me with some questions and I really hope they plan on answering them. *hint, hint* I loved 'Ghoul's Gym' so thank you to my guys.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wonderful!", "unixReviewTime": 1389830400, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2014"}

She's lost her wings and she's losing Aidan. He's no longer the boy she loved. And then there's Joshua. Why does it feel so right to be with him?As if she doesn't have enough on her mind, Bryn learns of a prophecy that predicts that she will be the reason for Odin's destruction. Bryn is desperate to find a way to change her future, and sets of to Yddrasil to speak to the Norns.Can Bryn change her Fate? Can she help Aidan find his path, while making the choice between him and Joshua? And can Bryn finally save Brody from the clutches of the Frost Giants?&#8221;&lt;/blockquote>The book opens pretty much where the second one left off - Bryn has been rescued, but too late to save her wings. During the ten or so days that she been captured in Dr. Lee's lab all kinds of terrible things had been done to her. It was clear from her condition that once they'd gotten all the information they were after they'd have killed her - luckily her friends got there first. Valkyrie Sigrun, as well as einherjar Amiee, Joshua, and Aidan are all there. Aidan, Bryn's boyfriend and the man she repeatedly risked her life to rescue, behaves atrociously. His behavior shocks everyone, making Bryn realize she probably never really knew him, though of course that doesn't stop the pain his behavior causes. Nevertheless, Bryn sticks by her word, and she and the team assist Aidan in rescuing his mother and sister, who had been Loki's hostages.Back at Asgard Bryn speaks with The All-Father, Odin, and his wife Frigga. Rather than the pity she so deeply fears, she is greeted with kindness, as well as shock, anger, and sorrow over the loss of her wings. After being debriefed by Odin, Bryn is sent off for healing with Eir, the Goddess of Mercy and Healing. While healing Bryn overhears Frigga and Eir discussing a prophecy that states she will be the cause of Odin's downfall.Hearing of the prophecy sparks a chain of events, beginning with Bryn sneaking in to speak with Odin's Oracle/Uncle, Mimir. From there she is sent on a series of quests, including rescuing the Gjallerhorn from Loki, rescuing the God Heimdall, to whom the Gjallerhorn belonged, and wounding Loki with a weapon that had been covered with the water from the Hall of Fate, located beneath the Yggdrasil, otherwise known as the Tree of Life.Throughout her adventures there are many surprises to be discovered, some of the happy kind, and some of the heartbreaking kind, as well as some that were not yet determined, having the potential to fall either way. Bryn has grown up quite a bit from the person we met in book one, and she continues to grow and mature, though she doesn't seem to be very self-aware much of the time. She often seems oblivious to her impact on others, be they Huldra, Einherjar, Warriors, or Gods. And yet she is a strong woman, without being closed off from her own emotions.While I've enjoyed this series it is beginning to feel a bit repetitive to me, or formulaic. Bryn must go on seemingly impossible tasks, against all odds, and she somehow manages to succeed each time. This happens a few times in each book, with all of the books ending on some sort of fantastic cliffhanger to ensure the readers return to find out what happens next. And while that method certainly works, I think it would be nice to have the characters make me return, not because they are in dire straits, but simply because I am invested in their story and would like to know what comes next. One could argue the two ending types are the same, but I obviously disagree.

Aldous \"gentleman scholar\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "We often see in news or in history, or encounter in our personal experience, events actually happening which seem too incredibly unlikely to be explicable as \"just chance\".  A long and continuing tradition outside mainstream science claims spiritual or paranormal significance to such coincidences or \"miraculous\" extraordinary events. A shorter tradition of rationalists -- mathematicians and statisticians -- seeks to debunk that claim, arguing that indeed such events are indeed explicable as \"just chance\" with no other significance. While this debunking topic usually forms a short section in other popular science style books on probability,  I believe this is the first such book specifically devoted to the topic.  As such, it is a valuable addition to the non-technical literature on chance.The author is a distinguished statistician who writes well.  Inevitably about half the book consists of topics overlapping with other popular books on probability -- the basic mathematics and historical development of probability; the normal curve; how we see apparent patterns in randomness; regression, survivor and such statistical effects in data; the cognitive biases popularized by KahnemanThinking, Fast and Slowand digressions such as the anthropic principle.  But the central theme is a clear exposition of the standard rationalist explanation of coincidence:  there are a vast number of possible events, so even if individual events are vastly unlikely, some such events will occur.  As a basic example \"someone must win the lottery\".  The book expands on that theme with a broad range of examples, both real examples from recent news or history and hypothetical examples to make a mathematical point.From an expert viewpoint, the only original feature is the invention and naming of some \"laws\".The law of inevitability (the lottery case),the law of truly large numbers (vast number of possible coincidences),the law of selection (``surgeons bury their failures\"),the law of the probability lever (inaccurate modeling of probabilities, as in the Sally Clark children's SIDS case),the law of near enough (we count near misses as hits).These are then wrapped up and called \"the improbability principle\".

While Janus does indeed get to work on a case, she ends up doing not-so-great at it and getting thrown off. But of course she doesn't let that stop her.In addition to that case, she also has another case to work on, and of course that doesn't go so well. And she has a friend who is being stalked by an old Creep. And her mom's health is going downhill fast. And her boyfriend is feeling neglected. AND her mom's boyfriend is over all the time and Janus feels he's trying to take over as her mom's caregiver and all-around Person-who-keeps-things-running. And she's not too happy about that.

I thought it showed the dangers of meeting strangers online adequately, though with a pretty dramatic end. I especially liked the lesson that if you share nude or risque photos with strangers online, what happens to or with those pictures is no longer in your control.

Reviews that said such things as \"a real love story at last\"...I'm guessing these are the same people that enjoyed Madame Bovary in college.The author tries for a clever stylized book that never achieves even a modicum of greatness. I'm not sure the writer liked Judith, but I'm sure I did not like her! The story is told in a past present mix. The first part gets tedious because you have one chapter of Judith in the present, realizing she is unhappy with her life, but not quite sure why, and then you have a chapter of young Judith, a glimpse of how she got to where she is. It goes back and forth like that. Then in part two (yes the author has created three parts)you mostly get young Judith. She is not an unpleasant kid, but she is kind of snotty and places herself above others. Typical teen. When present day Judith wonders about her own teen daughters tendency toward unpleasantness I want to tell her to look in the mirror!Young Judith falls for an older boy. When they start dating she is about 17 and he is at least 21, maybe 22. He is a boy who went to high school, played basketball, and now does carpentry because he doesn't want to work his fathers farm. He is a pretty simple guy who is going to live and die in the midwest town he was born in. We know he is folksy and common because the author tells us he pronounces \"Periwinkle\" as \"Perry Winkle\" which was not the first time I scratched my head and said wtf? But he is exceedingly kind and has some real insight into the nature of what makes people tick. Willy is a truly likeable person. But Judith wants to shake the dust of Rufus Sage off her feet, she is meant for something more. So when she gets into Stanford, she takes the opportunity, never looking back at Rufus Sage or Willy.So now she is an unsatisfied adult wondering what became of Willy her first love, and Deena and Patrick, the only two people she could call friends in Rufus Sage.I could never care about Judith. There was nothing compelling about her. Mostly I wanted to slap her. I loved Willy and thought she was an idiot for never really seeing who he was.At it's best, I guess it's a story that shows you can't go back and that you have to accept the choices you make. But that's me reaching for something good to say. A grand love story it most definitely is not!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Maybe the title is a direction for how best to read this book?", "unixReviewTime": 1394064000, "reviewTime": "03 6, 2014"}

It's nothing that I've obsessed about and read everything that I can get my hands on, but I know most of the gods and goddesses so this book was pretty interesting for me. By no means to you need to have this huge amount of background info on Greek mythology in order to enjoy this book but I think that a bit of knowledge might come in handy. It will just give you a sense of a back story to The Goddess Test.Jumping right in, this book was pretty good. I enjoyed how the author really stuck pretty true to the actual mythology and then wove her story in between those firmly established tales. Each of the characters that she created for this novel were pretty in line with how I would imagine that particular god or goddess to be in the modern day. Except for Hades. Hades is the god of the underworld, in case you didn't know. I just think someone who is in charge of world damnation would have been ... mean or have a gruff undercurrent to his character. I never really expected him to be almost timid or shy. Sure, I get that he's tortured by things in his very long past but still, something seemed off about him to me. I would think that Persephone leaving him would have made him more aggressive or dominating with his dark side but it really just turned him into a pansy in this book. I think I was waiting for him to come out of that shell and just take control or do something, I guess. I don't know. Like I said, something was off about him.I really liked the character of Kate. Man, the author wrote a great history for Kate and her mother. I really liked the mother as well - especially the further that you get into the story. But Kate ... she started to get whiny. I haven't heard anyone else say that after they have read this, I could have just been irritated and looking for something to be wrong ... but I wrote whiny on a post-it, so if it was important enough to waste a post-it on, I figured that I would bring it up. Sounds silly but you have NO IDEA how many post-its disappear at our house. Our boys take them to write &#34;tickets&#34; or stick on the cats or their own faces. We blow through a lot of them. I don't take post-it usage lightly. Lol.Anyhow, pretty good book ... there are quite a few characters, so make sure that you read this with a clear mind at first until you can get everyone straight.

I've now been through three sleepless nights staying up til the wee hours of the morning to read `just one more chapter'. I've cried almost harder than I've ever cried over a book before, I've laughed, I've felt love, loss, confusion, anger, betrayal, elation, relief... pretty much everything.The author calls this an atypical romance and I totally understand why. It's an unconventional story in every way. It steps outside the box, it defies the norm, and it comes out on top. It put my heart through the ringer but having finished it now, I can tell you that this is one of the best stories I have ever read.However.... it took me over a year to psych myself up to reading this series.I'll be honest, it scared the crap out of me.I love emotional stories -- they are my favorite kind -- but this one, ho boy!! I knew that one certain part of it would devastate me. So many readers told me that they ugly cried and I was sure I would too. But did I want to put myself through that??Well, I had to work myself up to it... but I always knew that YES, I did!I've always known the \"big spoiler\" from the end of the first book and I am so glad I did because honestly if I had dove in without knowing, I might have been too angry to process my emotions. But for me, knowing it in advance allowed me the time to come to terms with it, mull it over in my mind, and decide if this was a story I really wanted to read.And again, the answer was yes.When I was reading and I came to \"that point\" where the big spoiler happened (ps - it's not cheating) and I sobbed. Guys, I hadn't ugly cried this much since The Bronze Horseman. I was a wreck. I literally couldn't breathe, couldn't see the page through my tears, I was just overwhelmed with the emotions it drew out of me. My poor husband came running into the room and freaked when he saw me. I pretty much just sat there sobbing in his arms for what felt like forever.At this point, I wasn't sure I could go on. Honestly, I strongly debated putting the series down for good. I was devastated. But this story kept drawing me in. It was painful and took the term \"heart breaking\" to a whole new level but it was also beautiful. Very real. Raw. Not white-picket-fence-perfect to be sure... but I was feeling this journey so strongly and I couldn't wait to see the healing process.As the story went on, I can truly say that my heart was pieced back together. Did it still hurt? Yes. Absolutely. I don't think that part will ever stop hurting. I've been writing this review with tears pouring down my face at the memory of it. But I can honestly say that the story came full circle. The new developments and healing happened in such a believable, beautifully written way that I couldn't help but be swept away by it all.The most accurate way I've heard this described is quite simply an atypical romance. The things we've come to expect from the romance books we read each day do not happen here. Yes, there is a romance -- and intense, soul deep connection between the two people in love, but the story and the way things play out is anything but normal. But somehow, it just works.As a quick background, this is a completed series -- comprised of a prequel and 3 main novels -- with a fully resolved ending. This series takes place over a span of approximately 15 years. It was never rushed and took the time to fully allow you to experience each moment with the characters. It's not a quick read though and my advice is not to read them until you have the time to read all 3.5 books at once. Trust me. Even though they're broken down into 3 main books, it is one continuous story and it simply will not have the same impact on you if read them separately. So, when you're ready, just commit to them.I have the biggest book hangover imaginable now. I feel like I know these characters -- like I've lived their lives with them -- and letting go of them isn't easy. My thoughts keep going back to them.... and I know they will for a long time to come.I'm having a hard time finding anything to compare this series to for you guys... Regarding the first book and start of this series, I think the closest I can come to in terms of `feeling' is the Love Me With Lies trilogy and Present Perfect. It's obviously not at all the same story but it did evoke some similar emotions in me. But then in the second and third book, I just have nothing at all to compare it to -- it's just totally \"different\" and I can't even come up with a remotely similar comparison. There really is nothing else like these books out there and I just love that about them. They're utterly unique and incredibly powerful.Regarding rating -- I loved this story with all my heart. I truly did. In terms of writing, originality, and the sheer epic level of emotion it evoked in me over and over again, I have to give it 5 stars. This isn't to say it's perfect though because it did have a few flaws for me but honestly, I consider them insignificant and there is just no way that I can sit here, looking back over this stunning series and give it anything less than the 5 stars it deserves.I can't recommend this series highly enough. Go into it with an open mind and just allow it to take over your heart. It blew me away. I felt pure happiness, absolute devastation, and the ultimate healing.This truly is a one-of-a-kind, unforgettable love story.Series rating: 5 stars", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Unique and unforgettable!!! 5 STARS!!", "unixReviewTime": 1393718400, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2014"}

The true story of a lost boy, who finds his family decades later on another continent, is simply riveting. I'm pretty sure it was written by a ghost writer, as Larry Buttrose is given credit up front, but that's fine. The writing is a step above pedestrian - it's workman-like journalism - but it has some noteworthy benefits. For one thing, there is clearly a great respect for the privacy of people mentioned in it. Just one example: none of Saroo's girlfriends are mentioned by name except the one he is currently in a relationship with. There is also a very tactful handling of incidents which could have been dealt with in a far more salacious manner. In short, this is a mature and straightforward account of an exceptional little boy and an almost unbelievable saga. The plot is deceptively simple: a very young boy (perhaps five years old) winds up separated from his family in India, trapped on a train, and lands in Calcutta (now Kolkata). Against the odds, he survives and is adopted by a couple in Australia. He keeps the memory of his original family sharp, and in his mid-twenties decides to try and find them. Google Maps and Facebook play a big role in this, and despite setbacks and disappointment,..he finds them. It is an incredible story. Saroo is depicted in a fairly unassuming way, with much credit given to his friends, family (biological and adopted) and other people he meets along the way. This makes him a totally likable protagonist. He isn't perfect, but if there is anyone who deserves the kind of miraculous outcome after many trials, it's Saroo. His biological and adoptive mothers are also magnificent and admirable women. This is a book well worth your time and cash. The writing, as I stated, is not Dickens or Hemingway, but it is good-natured, clear and the story will carry you forward.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Don't miss this stop", "unixReviewTime": 1403654400, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2014"}

I thought of The Geography of You and Me as the book that would decide whether I ever read a Jennifer E. Smith book again. I liked The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight, I thought it was a solid read with a fun premise and I happily gave it three stars. This is What Happy Looks Like did not make me happy, in fact, it made me very unhappy and made my list of the worst books of 2013. But The Geography of You and Me snuck up on me and really charmed me.What made the story work for me? If I had to pick one thing I would say Lucy. I fell for Lucy head over heels. She&#8217;s a quiet, shy, sweet 16-year-old who lives in New York City. When the story starts her older twin brothers, really her only friends, have just left for college and her parents are jet-setting around Europe (their typical MO). I&#8217;ll admit I found Lucy&#8217;s friendlessness and isolation a little odd, but still, there was something about the way Jennifer E. Smith wrote her story that clicked with me and allowed me to really relate to Lucy.Lucy is riding the elevator back up to her apartment when the building, and the entire east coast, loses power. I wasn&#8217;t living in NYC during the 2003 blackout, but I did lose power on Long Island, where I was living, and even though it was really annoying I also remember it being really fun. Trapped in the elevator with Lucy is Owen, the new superintendent&#8217;s son who is on his way to the building&#8217;s roof. Owen&#8217;s mother has just passed away and he and his father moved to NYC in the hopes of starting over both personally and professionally, but Owen hates the noise and hustle and bustle of the city and longs to see the stars at night.The book&#8217;s description says that Lucy and Owen explore the city, but that&#8217;s not quite what happens. When they are freed from the elevator they head to Lucy&#8217;s apartment, they check out the neighborhood, get water and ice cream, and then spend the night on the building&#8217;s roof, where it&#8217;s cooler and Owen can finally see the stars. The next morning the spell is broken and Owen is gone and Lucy goes back to her normal life. That is until her parents suddenly decide to fly her over to Europe and then tell her they might be moving to London. Lucy&#8217;s family ends up moving to Edinburgh and Owen and his father leave to NYC to head out west.Lucy and Owen do keep in touch, and Jennifer E. Smith draws parallels between what each of them is doing on different continents, but, even though they send each other the occasional postcard and think of each other often, they&#8217;re living very separate, different lives. Lucy&#8217;s family is very wealthy and they live in a nice house in Edinburgh and she goes to a fancy school (where she makes friends and meets a cute boy) and they travel all over Europe. Owen and his father, on the other hand, are barely making ends meet, moving from place to place to try to find work for his dad. Even though their very different financial situations were never mentioned I really liked how Jennifer E. Smith subtly wove them into the story.One of the things that drove me nuts about This is What Happy Looks Like was the incredibly awkward third-person narrative. At the New York City Teen Author Fest Jennifer E. Smith talked about how she always writes in third-person and I don&#8217;t remember it about The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight so it must not have bothered me. In the case of The Geography of You and Me the third-person narrative really worked, it&#8217;s part of what made it so charming to me and was probably the most pleasant surprise about reading this story.A friend, someone I used to work with and the person who leant me this ARC, told me that she liked this book, but felt like it had every recent YA cliche. I&#8217;ll admit I hadn&#8217;t thought about that before, but after she said it I gave it some thought and I don&#8217;t disagree with her. There&#8217;s the whole one-night, instant connection thing; the postcards and emails that they write back and forth; the kind of fairytale feel to the story; and the travel, both domestic and international that&#8217;s woven into Lucy and Owen&#8217;s lives. I debated whether I thought I should hold that against Jennifer E. Smith, but in the end I decided not to. Is there glory to be had in writing an interesting, entertaining book with story elements that aren&#8217;t currently in vogue? I don&#8217;t think that makes it better. Is there glory in writing an interesting, entertaining book with story elements that are currently in vogue? I would say so.Bottom Line: After liking and disliking Jennifer E. Smith&#8217;s previous two most recent books I was pleasantly surprised by The Geography of You and Me and really fell for the Lucy character. If you&#8217;re like me and were disappointed by This is What Happy Looks Like give Smith another shot, I&#8217;m glad I did.

The ultimate compliment I can give these poems is that I wish I wrote them; Howe's style is both accessible and sophisticated and her subject matter is TRULY the Kingdom of Ordinary time. She quests to find the sacred in the profane, or moreover, eliminating the very CATEGORY of profane time and experience. Errands are holy, caring for her ailing mother is communion, and having the same conversation with her daughter after school every day is prayer.I learned a lot as a poet from reading Howe. She expertly uses the concrete image to BECOME the emergent meaning of the poem, rather than ending where it seemed she was headed in he first line. If I have any critique here, it is that many of Howe's poems follow a similar form---expository or introductory image, exploration of that image, and then the introduction of a SEEMINGLY unrelated second concrete image which sheds light through juxtaposition on the first. Again, this is both a strength a minor weakness. There is a certain intuitive rhythm Howe establishes in repeating this format.Needless to say, I immediately ordered the rest of Howe's books as soon as I finished reading this one.(less)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Queen of The Kingdom of Ordinary Time", "unixReviewTime": 1398211200, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2014"}

Amazing, heart-stopping hero! I had a feeling this was going to be a good book from the blurb and it absolutely lived up to my expectations.Honor's a normal woman who is actually a romance novelist (LOVED that.) She's out running on a wooded Pennsylvania trail when she is abducted. This girl is tough...wow, she did all the right things...fighting back with everything she had, but it just wasn't enough when faced with a bigger, stronger guy and she ended up beaten up and in a hole in the middle of the woods. But she's smart and resourceful and managed to sneak the guys cell phone during their struggle. She has very little signal so when there's an incoming text, she answers it with a plea for help. That texting exchange is with Nathan, a marine who plays poker with her abductor (and obviously has no idea about what kind of guy he truly is.)But Nathan is all things good and heroic. Through a bizarre set of events, he provides Honor with a lifeline. Truly, this guy is tough and strong and protective and all things amazingly heroic. I loved how reluctant he was to leave her side...ever throughout the book. He simply wanted her safe and feeling secure. He has his own nightmares so he understands a lot of what she's going through with her trauma and that makes him that much more. *sigh* I absolutely and totally fell in love with Nathan.It's a great romantic story with a lot of drama and suspense.

The coincidence of two deaths happening at the same time in a small village lead the police to think they may be linked, so newly promoted Louisa Smith finds her first case as DCI leading the Major Crime team head is to investigate both. She soon discovers that the murder victim Polly has been the cause of jealousy in more than one relationship around the village, and that she also had links to local gangster Nigel Maitland, on whom the police have never been able to get enough evidence to charge with anything...This is probably the most 'procedural' police procedural I've read. Haynes, who apparently was a police intelligence analyst for several years in real life, gives a very detailed and convincing picture of how a police investigation works. She includes copies of reports, departmental e-mails and other case documents as a method of providing a feeling of verisimilitude to her story. On the whole this works well - Haynes keeps it down to a level where it remains interesting. However, she also includes fairly in-depth descriptions of team meetings and briefings, and while these make the investigation feel very realistic they also slow the plot down a little too much. The picture that most investigations are probably 90% routine tedium is, I'm sure, more accurate than the usual action-fest, but perhaps the book veers a little too much towards authenticity at the expense of entertainment on occasion.The plot is complex and interesting, if a bit patchy at times - the obvious gets overlooked or we revert back to something that has already been considered earlier and dismissed. There are a couple of fairly lengthy episodes of S&M; sex but, while the detail is considerably more graphic than necessary, they are integral to the plot. Some of the characterisation is excellent, particularly of the police officers, while in other cases it can be a bit superficial and less credible, and occasionally Haynes changes a character's personality midway through to fit in with a twist in the plot. DCI Smith herself is an appealing detective - ambitious and hard-working and without the usual angst issues. She has a fairly strong moral code which she tries hard to live up to and is a conscientious boss, loyal to her colleagues.Overall, I found this a good read - not perfect, but with some solid writing and original touches that lifted it well above average. I don't know whether Haynes intends to make this into a series, but I'd be happy to meet Louisa Smith and her colleagues again.

She traveled the world crafting a well-received assortment of timely fiction, award-winning short stories, expository essays, and astute political commentary. Most of this writing is polished, shrewd, and overflowing with wry, witty observations. Each one of her works displays a writing talent many would argue is more sophisticated -- if somewhat less endearing -- than that of her mother, Laura Ingalls Wilder (though certain scholars maintain that several of Wilder's manuscripts were heavily edited by her daughter prior to publication).I love both authors, but these days Rose Wilder Lane's works represent an undiscovered pleasure for many readers. This particular collection of short stories gives us a highly entertaining glimpse into the goings-on of an unnamed small town in turn-of-the-century Mid-America. The author crafts a dynamic cast of characters, focusing on one or two with each vignette but weaving many of them throughout the book. Lane was a noted feminist, and many of these tales include telling commentary on the narrow-mindedness of small town life and the cultural plight of women at that particular point in history.Through it all, though, Lane manages to convey a sincere affection for her characters and their resilience in the face of hardship.Brimming with humor, poignancy, and nostalgia, these stories breathe life into a time and place long disappeared, yet in many ways still easily recognizable. If you enjoy movies like &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34; or &#34;Meet Me in St. Louis,&#34; I highly suggest giving these stories a try.

I love how she combines suspense, action, mystery, and danger with hot romance in her stories!  When I got offered, The Darkest Joy for review, I was happy to dive right in.  For one, the cover is absolutely beautiful, and the book summary sounded very intriguing!The story complety hooked me, and had me turning pages like a crazy woman from the very beginning.  Brooke is a local piano prodigy in Seattle, who is looking forward to her upcoming tryouts for Juilliard.  Playing the piano has been her passion and the dream of both herself and her family for many years.  Brooke is running late on her way to her parents house for the holidays, due to a car accident.  On her way home, she is talking to her mother on the telephone when the door bell rings.  What follows is the violent and excruciating screams of her family members, as she hangs on to the telephone helpless and in shock.  Then, she hears the killer breathing in to the telephone.  After the killer hangs up the phone, Brooke goes in to shock.  At this point in the story, nothing could have turned me away from my kindle.  What follows, is the confirmation of her mother, father, brother, and Great Aunt Milli's deaths.Brooke leaves Seattle, because she needs a new beginning, and there are too many memories there.  She leaves for Alaska, to live in her Great Aunt Milli's cabin, and gets a job as a deckhand on a fishing boat for the summer, with the sexy and good-looking Chance Taylor.  What follows is a dark love story about Brooke's journey to heal, and move on with her life.  Along the way, she finds herself falling in love with Chance, but can she trust him, when the locals warn her that he isn't a one woman kind of man?  Soon, Brooke learns from her best friend Lacey, and FBI agent Decatur Clearwater that the murderer is killing other family's of piano prodigies that were also competing to attend Juilliard.  Unfortunately, Brooke learns that you can't escape your past, and she may be in danger.I enjoyed, The Darkest Joy, by Marata Eros!  My favorite aspects of this story was the suspense, mystery, and complex plot!  I think that the story would have been better with less description, and more development in the relationship between Chance and Brooke.  There were a lot of sexy love scenes, and I enjoyed seeing how strong and resilient Brooke was as a character.  I admired the way Ms. Eros did an excellent job of realistically showing us the various stages of grief through Brooke's eyes.  I could see and feel all of her emotions; from shock, to anger, to sadness, and then finally to acceptance, and healing.  Chance had an air of mystery to him, and I enjoyed learning his secrets and background.  I give  The Darkest Joy by Marata Eros 3.5 Emotional, Riveting, and Suspense Filled Stars!  If you enjoy romantic suspense, and stories where you get to unravel the mystery of a serial killer, I recommend that you check out, The Darkest Joy!My Favorite Quotes:&#34;This is the nature of grief.  A small, seemingly insignificant comment or memory comes to the surface in an unguarded moment.  You're helpless against it.  Like the tide, it washes over you and however much you cling to the rocks, the ocean breaks you down with its tireless cycle, until bits of you are carried away on the current.&#34;  (eARC, Loc. 379)~Brooke&#34;The darkest joy is better than none at all.

Taken separately it seems weird... But it's not. Yet another interesting view into how really messed up our current situation could become without that separation of church and state. It seems particularly poignant at this moment in history when the female of our species is under attack from so many angles not only in third world countries but also in the US with politics trying so hard to govern a woman's rights over her own body.

I couldn't help but feel their pain, their struggles and their need for revenge.And seriously, this book had one of the best opening lines ever, talk about an attention grabber!If you want an action packed kick butt, nonstop adventure with some paranormal elements thrown in, some steamy love interests, awesome friendships and bonds and danger lurking around ever bend, this is a UF series you do not want to miss out on.Estep showed me what a great writer she is in her YA series but I had no idea just how much that talent extended until starting this one. I can not wait to dive right back into Gin's world and devour every last page.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "3.5 Stars!", "unixReviewTime": 1399939200, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2014"}

He had seen human trafficking at it&#8217;s worst and was scared something would happen to someone in this group.He was right.On the last day Wren is kidnapped.  Using his knowledge, his instincts, Stone was off to find her.This book is gritty and hard to read at times, I think it realistically showed us what happens to people who are sold into the sex trade business.  I&#8217;ve never seen it up close and personal, but from what I have read, what Wren saw is what happens.  It&#8217;s horrible.

Otte carefully analyzes how Austria-Hungary resolved on war with Serbia, obtained its \"blank cheque\" from Germany, and then plunged ahead with utter disregard for consequences. Great attention is paid to the record of telegrams and meeting notes. Unless one reads all through Albertini, it's unlikely this has been done as well anywhere else - and even so, Otte has the benefit of decades of research Albertini didn't.One should not, however, blame this book for what it is NOT. The background to July 1914 is barely sketched in. (Macmillan's recent \"The War That Ended Peace,\" however silly the title, is excellent in this regard - political, social, military backgrounds.) Otte takes note of war plans only to the barest extent necessary. Moltke is very much a background figure here; see Mombauer's fine book on him for a different account.Chiding Christopher Clark & others, Otte thinks judgment is both possible and necessary. Besides the obvious culprits, the Germanic powers, Otte places great weight on Russia's decision to mobilize; given that Austria couldn't be ready before August 12, did it have to be done so soon? But his avoidance of military details makes it difficult, I think, for him to back up that criticism. And as he concedes, mobilization appeared to Russia the only way to convince Austria to back down. Had Austria not rested confident that Germany would handle Russia, it might well have worked. Another reservation is that there's very little discussion of the German DOW vs. Russia (and the one vs. France) - why were they necessary?As other reviewers have noted, Grey comes off very well here - not undeservedly, I would say. I knew about Paleologue's sins of omission, but Tschirsky, the German ambassador to Vienna, eclipses the Frenchman in ambassadorial swashbuckling.Finally, a big THANK YOU to Cambridge U P for using footnotes not endnotes.

Strangely, no one in the pack is answering their  phones when Mercy calls to report in about their crunchy delay. There is only one cryptic text message directly from Bran.  Then Mercy and Jesse get back to Mercy's garage to find that the entire pack, except for the delightfully foul-mouthed Ben, have been kidnapped by mysterious government soldier-agents.I have complained about other series' subscriptions to The Power of the Month Club. Unfortunately, I think that the Mercy Thompson series can now be termed The Political Power Play of the Month club.  While most of the players aren't human, that doesn't mean it's not politics.  I can't explain more without giving away the big bad plot reveal, but suffice to say I did have a WHAT? moment when the doorbell rang. Really. The book was over at that point. The police were notified, Adam was plotting his press conference, and there was pizza for everyone. Then suddenly a whole new set of characters showed up, and we are off to watch another fight over political problems that no one knew mattered before that page got turned. The more I think about it, the more I wonder if the ending of Frost Burned was plucked out of the pile of &#34;Rejected Fight Scenes for Bone Crossed.&#34;And speaking of politics, in the opening scenes, the readers are reminded of what happened over in the parallel series (Alpha and Omega): that the greater Fae have rejected the US Government's laws and justice... and disappeared.  However, the only impacts this appears to have on Frost Burned is that our cute half-breed Tad finally gets to show his daddy's powers, the characters never visit Uncle Mike's, and Zee is... just as cranky as usual. Never mind. Roll on...The other fun crossover from Alpha and Omega is that Asil plays a strong and nuanced role in supporting the good government agents. Call me twisted, but I really enjoy Asil's manners and mannerisms. As a werewolf who is older than the Colonies of the New World, Asil's presence provides a deeper contrast and coloration of the other characters, especially Zee.Along with Asil's trip into this series, Frost Burned is a roll-call of almost every character I've ever known and liked. We get a lot of Kyle time and a good amount of Jesse time, and everyone down to Mary Jo and Honey have a role - even if they only have one growl to add to the conversation. (The absence of Samuel is actually more obvious because of it.)From the car accident to a house invasion or two, to street fights (hi, Tony!) and beyond, this book is nearly non-stop action.  There are the usual arguments about how to save people and whether there are bad guys hiding in particular places. And Mercy makes her typical decisions to ride to the rescue despite risk to life, limb, and of course, vehicle.  The point of view bounces from Mercy to Adam and back, with some interesting pack-bond magic providing the bridge for some of the characters knowing what they shouldn't because of where they are.I had a great time reading Frost Burned. Briggs has fantastic talent with dialog that resonates perfectly with my warped sense of humor. I recommend this story to anyone who wants to go on with the Mercy Thompson series, regardless of your opinion of River Marked.  I'll offer one spoiler for you, too: we are not playing Hospital Visit of the Month in this series. See?

I am completely torn all to pieces. This book was extremely wonderful. The beginning was filled of so much hope and there is so much love between all of the characters. I have loved this series from the very first book.  So while reading this one I had so many emotions because it&#8217;s the end of the series and the characters journeys.Scarlett is such a wonderful character. I have loved getting to know her through the books. Watching her grow into the person she wanted to be and deserved to be. She was so strong and vibrant. I loved that both Mason and Ash helped her to grow and show her that she could spread her wings and fly on her own. She also had some amazing friends in her life that helped to keep her on the right path and was there for her when things got bad. I couldn&#8217;t imagine being in her shoes and having to pick between two great loves.Ash! O how I loved that boy. I wanted him and Scarlett together from the very beginning. I knew they were meant to be together because of their instant connection. He was such an amazing guy in this book; I fell deeper for him because of it. He was always telling Scarlett she was his butterfly and that he wanted her to do things her own and make her own decisions. He loved her no matter what and believed in her. It was so touching. So help me I&#8217;m about to cry again just talking about him. He was perfect.Then you have Mase.  I have never been so conflicted on which guy I wanted the girl with in a book. They were both perfect for her. Both of them were amazing men. Mase we a big hearted and wonderful guy. Full of so much love. I really loved that in this book he kept remind Scarlett that he loved her and that they could be friends no matter what because he just wanted her in his life. How can you not love a man who sacrifices his own feelings to let the woman he loves be happy? I felt so bad for all he was going through but so proud of how he handled everything.So that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to give you just that I was beyond sad to see this story end and with that and how the ending went I am completely shattered. I was pretty much a bawling mess of tears through the whole ending of this book. I will probably continue to cry when I think about it. It was just so depressing and my heart just shattered. So make sure you have tissues handy. Besides all the sadness I feel inside after reading this book, I am still overwhelmed with joy for the characters.

It is yet another viewpoint on the Holocaust.  It takes place in Copenhagen, Denmark (I believe).Although the characters (children) didn't suffer, times WERE tough.  When the resistance was trying to save as many Jews as possible from the Nazis, Annemarie's best friend Ellen Rosen is sent to live with her for a period of time, until it is safe to make their next move.  Until Ellen reunites with her mother and father, she is introduced as Lise (Annemarie and Kirstie's  older sister who died earlier from the war effort). (at that time Ellen broke her Star of David necklace trying to take it off and hide it from the soldiers).When things appear to get seriously out of control, Inge's husband or Papa insists that Mama take the kids to Uncle Henrik's place- that they will be safe there.  So they left Copenhagen for a time, but Papa stayed behind, so that things didn't look suspicious.  Ellen's family was Jewish, However, the Johansen's were not.  Soon after their arrival to Uncle Henrik's, Ellen reunited with her parents, but it was no easy reunion.  Continue reading, to see how they were escorted to a safe rendezvous point, so that they could travel to neutral territory (Sweden).  None of that would have been possible without the support and help of Annemarie, Kirstie, Uncle Henrik, Inge, or Lise's old fiance- Peter.To protect the children, the adults talk in riddles.  Continue reading to see the other things that they do to confuse the German soldiers and their dogs.I believe that Number the Stars got its name because towards the end of the book,  Ellen compared the stars to the universe, and they are many.  So if these two friends are worlds apart, all they have to do is look up into the night sky on a clear night and know that they will soon meet again.  The war, at that point was two years from over.There could also have been meaning within the Star of David necklace that Ellen wore.  It was the one star that Annemarie wanted her Papa to fix upon Ellen's safe arrival home.Happy reads.  I believe it is a good book for children- especially in 4th and 5th grade.  It will help them to get another focal point on the Holocaust.  Although it is a work of fiction, some of the things that they did to throw off the soldiers were true, as were the resistance.  The resistance really did help come to the aid of seeking safe passage for the Jews.

In the beginning, it reminded a little of some of Steinbeck's work, simply because McMurtry spends quite a bit of time on character development and giving the reader a very strong sense of place. Then, without even realizing it, you find yourself smack in the middle of the plot. The start of the cattle drive is a real turning point of the story. There was actually a point near the beginning of the drive when I had to pause in surprise at the turn that the novel had taken. I remember thinking &#34;Oh man, this just got REAL.&#34; Despite its length, I felt a little sad when I finished Lonesome Dove because there was no more left to read.

I was actually pretty surprised at how much I liked the plot of Maiden Flight. A lot of the story was world building, character introduction, and crazy hot m/f/m sexytimes. This is my first m&eacute;nage a trios read so it&#8217;s exciting to get something new under the reading belt. Being a short kindle freebie I was pretty satisfied overall. I&#8217;ve read some reviews that mention how similar this is to Anne McCaffrey&#8217;s Dragonriders of Pern series and I can&#8217;t comment on that because I haven&#8217;t had the chance to start her books yet. I can do some similarities between authors and the worlds they create but I really don&#8217;t like copycats, just saying. I hope I don&#8217;t find out in the future that it was a little too alike for my tastes&#8230;The storyline concept was actually really interesting if not a little over-the-top. The dragons are intelligent, fierce, and very loyal warriors. They are matched with a human knight that they can telepathically communicate with. But the bond doesn&#8217;t stop there &#8211; the dragons are unable to mate until their knight counterparts find their mate first. Why, might you ask? Well knight and dragon have such a unique bond that they can actually feel what the other feels. So in other words the dragon sex drive is so strong that it would drive their knight insane if they had no mate to run to. This exceptional fact made all the sex scenes pretty fascinating. If there was human sex, there was sure to be dragon sex involved as well, and vice versa. This I could handle. The insta-love on the other hand I had an issue with.I mentioned in a previous review that I used to absolutely adore the idea of love at first sight. It&#8217;s such a dreamy and romantic idea that I still sometimes like to daydream about it. But reality and reading well-paced romantically involved books has shifted my judgment. I find myself actually cringing and rolling my eyes pretty far in the back of my head when insta-love hits a heroine and/or hero. Sadly in Maiden Flight&#8217;s case the couple (and the third-wheel!) gets hit pretty hard. Now of course once I got my eyes to focus in their proper position I just accepted the fact that it was part of the story. After that I could enjoy most of what was going on.  I actually enjoyed the romantic situation between the heroine&#8217;s mother and her perspective beau. It was slower-paced and much more realistic.Although there wasn&#8217;t much of a plot to be found I still enjoyed the book. I liked Maiden Flight so much that I went ahead and bought the next couple of books to see how the story progresses. I am hoping the sex scenes become a little bit more creative and the characters get more fleshed out. I&#8217;m hoping for more of the plot to come to the forefront about the war going on, the politics within the Lair, and I&#8217;d like to see more interaction between the characters. I like me some sex but I also like some dialogue, some intrigue, something, anything really.

If you're a writer or an introvert, I can almost (practically) guarantee at some point this book is going to hit you in a very relatable way. I was so emotionally invested in this book. Gosh. Look at me. I'm a fangirling (ha, pun) mess. I can't even write a logical review! I seriously just love this book so much.I really connected to the characters! Can we just talk about Cath for a moment? She has a social anxiety disorder and (knowing from experience) it is written so DANG WELL, I nearly cried. Cath didn't find the cafeteria in her dorm for 3 weeks because she was too scared. She lived off peanut butter and protein bars. That's totally something I would do. (Says she who has emergency peanut butter in her room.) All of Cath's quirks and introverted ways...I just related to, so this made the book hugely special to me. I felt like the author had written it FOR me, which is awesome. Thanks Rainbow Rowell, me old pal. (Har, har.)Oh, yeah, there were other characters besides Cath. Duh. SO. I have to mention Cath's identical twin first: Wren. (Yes, their names are &#34;Cather&#34; and &#34;Wren&#34;...their mother wasn't expecting twins.) Wren made me angry. I understood that she was flexing wings and needed to try &#34;life without her sister&#34;. But, as Levi ends up mentioning, it's like Wren &#34;broke up&#34; with Cath. It's sad. You can't just dump someone when you want to look for other options. And they're sisters! Cath is an introvert dumped in a scary new college...Wren, let me hit you with a book. Wren made me angry the whole time, but she was very well written as a character. (An annoying character).Levi was kind of adorable. I loved him a lot...although, yeah, *squints eyes suspiciously at Levi* He had issues. I don't actually see this as a love-triangle at all. While there are potentially two love-interests, I think it handles like real life and not like a triangle where two random guys are vying for the &#34;invisible&#34; girl's affections (which, let's face it, is very unlikely). That saying, also: I HATE NICK.Reagan was brilliant! I'm totally in awe of how she was written....she was perfectly mean and sweet all at once.Plot? Weeell, to be honest, I got to 50% and asked my sister (who'd already read this) &#34;What the heck are they going to do for the rest of the book?1&#34; They sure found plenty to do, though, even if it isn't breakneck speed or mind numbing suspense. The entire book is hugely addictive. I could NOT put it down.Writing? Beautiful. I admit to not being the biggest fan of Eleanor and Park , but I love Rainbow Rowell's style. It's amazing. Addictive. Clear. Oh, and concise! And I love it how she writes about issues close to home. Nothing is unrealistic or unreal about her books. I love how she weaves her characters' relationships in and out until they're just as complicated as in the real world.Okay! Okay! I'll stop gushing. But seriously: introverts, this is a story written specifically for you. I haven't been so invested in a book since the beginning of the year. I just...yeah. Brilliant.

The indomitable Chief Inspector Birdsong, loyal and ever-reliable Nick Dennison and of course the lovely Madelaine Her formidable Aunt Ruth also makes a dramatic entrance, determined take Madelaine back to America and away from the supposedly harmful influence of Drew.He however has proposed to her, and is determined to stay at Fathering Manor until she makes a decision. Of course, the genre being what it is murder soon ensues and all the inhabitants are caught up in another investigation. Its hard for thus mystery buff to fault the story itself with the collection of cryptic clues, red herrings, false leads, assorted suspects and motives, and an unexpected culprit.However, as with the last installment Death by the Book I couldn&#8217;t help feeling the body count was rather high. It almost seemed as though when the pace of the book began to slow, another murder was thrown in to maintain interest- and that for me is not necessary or pleasant.Also, there seems to be an awful lot of crime and intrigue for a small Hampshire village-considering how even today the city if Winchester. prides itself on being one of the safest places in the UK- with one of the lowest crime rates.That said, I did take some pleasure from the regional setting, recognizing some of the Winchester streets.Also, again I didn&#8217;t feel Drew and Madelaine&#8217;s behaviour was entirely consistent or logical. Aunt Ruth wanted to keep them from doing anything inappropriate. considering how they seemed to constantly end up kissing or displaying more intimacy than would have been acceptable between and unmarried couple at the time. Though they insist they&#8217;re not doing anything wrong &#8211; and generally are not- and protest much I for one could not help siding with Aunt Ruth as the moderating influence.There was also the Christian content. Not &#8216;in your face&#8217; or cliched, but sometimes hardly there at all. Its touching that Drew uses his new-found faith to help people, or say a timely word here and there, but I didn&#8217;t like the way that often misquoted and misunderstood scripture passages were used. I have been taught for instance Jesus didn&#8217;t condemn the woman caught in adultery because he had not witnessed the act- but he also told her to &#8216;go and sin no more&#8217;.It seems to me many Christians ignore that part of the passage.In my opinion it is not &#8216;judging&#8217; or unchristian to tell a person their actions are wrong, harmful or damaging if that is the case.Finally, whilst the American author generally did a spiffingly good job of accurately representing the speech and accent of the English characters without too many stereotypes there were one or two noticeable errors. For instance Drew and Nick say &#8216;someplace&#8217; rather than &#8216;somewhere&#8217; which is the term commonly used in Britain.Overall, a good mystery with more than a passing nod to the classics, but also one which left me unsure whether I want to continue with the series. To see Drew and Madelaine&#8217;s relationship develop perhaps, but not if there are quite so many murders&#8230;.Thanks to Netgalley and Bethany House for approving my request for this book in exchange for an honest review.

In perfect Caisey Quinn fashion I was pulled into Van and Stella's story. It isn't a pretty one, but then again not all love stories are.Van is an addict. Sex, drugs, and rock n roll. The whole shebang. He uses alcohol and whatever drugs he can get his hands on to take him away, to numb him from everything in his past, and when that doesn't work sex does. He's drowning in all of it. He's offered his last second chance. Go to the Second Chance rehab facility and clean up or lose his band.Stella Jo wants something different out of life than running around and doing her mama's bidding. She just wants to feel something, to make a change. So instead of running back home to mama she takes a job at Second Chance Ranch Rehab.I loved seeing Van and Stella's story unfold. It was messy, ugly, sad, and beautiful all at the same time. The hardest thing in life to understand sometimes is that life isn't always pretty, sometimes it's ugly. It makes you want to check out for awhile. To forget, to stop feeling anything but oblivion. This book helps remind us of that. However it also helps remind us that life is about more than one, two, or even three chances. Sometimes all it takes is having that one person in your corner to help you fight your battles, to help remind you that you don't have to do it alone.This is one of my favorite Caisey Quinn books. She continues to amaze me with not just her writing ability but with her ability to take on something darker than she usually writes and to knock it out of the park!If you want a simple, butterflies and roses romance story this isn't it.

Creative, inventive, touching, even scary at moments, it is the work of a true master at both the craft and art of writing.Most of the characters are inherited from the previous book, including the main character,  Tyson (The Kid), an incredibly smart, precocious young fellow who is as broken as he is brilliant. Ty and his his brother, Derrick (Bear), were abandoned by their mother when Ty was only five. Bear raised him, being father, friend and brother to Ty. He is the only one who could get him through the panic attacks that have ruled his life, holding him and exhorting him to \"breathe... hold, two...hold,...three...hold, breathe\". He pretty much gave up his life to support and protect The Kid and, along the way, married the love of his life, Oliver (Otter).Ty has only one friend in the world, an overgrown boy, some years older than him, whom he befriended when he was assiduously tracking an ant on the sidewalk. The two became inseparable, and Dominic (Dom) became part of his family. Dominic was damaged, too, which is likely why the two felt such an immediate bond. When Dominic was just a kid, his father attacked his mother, in front of him, and though he stabbed him seven times to protect her, he was too late to save her. He never got over that and spent the rest of his youth bouncing around the Foster Care system.Although Dominic was huge and strong, he was shy and withdrawn. Only Ty brought him out of his shell. Their love never went beyond friendship, if for no other reason, the age difference between them would have made a more intimate relationship out of the question.At the age of 15, Ty is accepted at Dartmouth and has to leave Seafare, Oregon, his home, and move to New Hampshire to attend school. Of course, this rips the two best friends apart. Even worse, Ty sees Dom kissing a woman and, literally, flips out, hiding in a bathtub and unable to breathe. Now he knows that the boy he loves more than anyone with the exception of his brother, Bear, is not available, and never will be.For the next four years, Ty will neither accept calls nor visits from Dom - and he is falling apart. The main plot of the book is the journey of these two wonderful, but damaged men, back to each other.\"The Art Of Breathing\" is a complex book with a host of subplots and secondary characters, every one of them well-developed, unique, eccentric and brimming with personality. Among them is Ty's bigendered Dartmouth friend, Corey (sometimes Kori) and the friends she brings into Tyson's life, including a renowned female impersonator and a whole cast of bizarre and loving people surrounding her, a long-lost sister, a horny \"straight\" college roommate who keeps trying to get Ty into bed, Dom's spouse, a team of horny frat boys playing volleyball on the beach, and the beloved Mrs. Paquinn whose voice is heard throughout the book despite the fact that she is long-departed.And speaking of voices, I don't know any contemporary author who handles dialogue as well as Mr. Klune. Not only is it believable and authentic, it's sometimes poetic and, often, totally over-the-top. In his role as protector, Bear is known to have flights of paranoia. One such amazing scenario spins out when Ty is scheduled to drive his roommate from Oregon to Tucson. Bear is terrified of the two driving, alone, 1500 miles from home. He goes into this wild riff in which he fantasies that their car breaks down in the desert, right next to a former meatpacking plant. Ty, the vegetarian animal activist would, of course, have to explore it, at which time he would be kidnapped by the serial-killing cult that inhabits the plant.... you get the drift. These excursions into fantasy are often hilarious. In fact, the book is laugh-out-loud funny in places, even as it deals with difficult and sad situations, leaving the reader confused as to whether to laugh or cry. As I mentioned earlier, I did both - often at the same time.The writing is nothing less than brilliant. I bookmarked some passages just to go back and enjoy the rhythm, metaphor, poetry and laugh-out-loud humor of some of Mr. Klune's words.One of the secondary characters, Anna, admonishes her young son, JJ:\"And why don't we eat glitter and glue any more? Anna asked her son.Because you said it makes my poop look like abstract art.\"Despite the humor and the incredibly interesting and attractive characters, Mr. Klune has some very serious points to make about family - and how so many traditional families fail, resulting in damaged kids. And how important it is that, today, we have the invaluable opportunity to make our own families, families built on love, not accident of birth. The whole book, in fact, is a paean to friendship, commitment and brotherhood.There is one meme that ties the whole book together - a single word that the nine-year-old Ty just learned the same day that he met Dominic - \"inevitable\". That very first day, when asked by Ty whether they would be best friends, Dom replies \"It's inevitable\". All through the book, inevitability keeps popping up to tie its many parts together. And, of course, Dom and Tyson are, indeed, inevitable.If you're looking for a first-class read with brilliant characters and equally brilliant writing, this is the book. If you're looking for a book that's profoundly beautiful, this is the book.

This person is lost, but you know the Way. For a little while you have the opportunity to walk along together,&#8221; Melody Rossi writes in the introduction of her book, &#34;Sharing Christ with the Dying: Bringing Hope to Those Near the End of Life.This one hundred and ninety-two page paperback targets those interested in helping others who are dying, especially solidifying their relationship with Jesus Christ. Mainly the New American Standard Version of the Bible is used, along with the NIV, NKJV, TEV, NLT, and ESV. Due to its subject of dying and death, it would not be appropriate for immature readers.Watching a loved one die is heart-wrenching, humbling, and sad. Confidently knowing if the person will be in Heaven with the Lord is peaceful, joyous, and gives hope. In Rossi&#8217;s book, comfort and encouragement are blended with information and tips to assist dealing with the end of life on this earth.After acknowledgements and an introduction, there are four divisions of eighteen chapters along with an appendix. With bullet point lists, Bible verses for support, and tips, the book also contains the writer&#8217;s own experiences having dealt with four loved ones&#8217; passing in a twenty-eight month period.Explaining how she was available when her mother, stepmom, and father accepted Christ&#8217;s gift of eternal salvation on their death beds, the first part of the book is about being called by God on the who, what, why, when, where, and how in regard to serving at one&#8217;s side during their last days. Questionnaires are included for the caregiver and loved one.Part two offers tools such as helping loved ones know their eternal destination and getting personal and professional support, along with obtaining documentation for medical, end-of-life wishes, et cetera.The third section discusses the caregiver&#8217;s role more in depth and involves spiritual warfare, having endurance, and leaning on God&#8217;s love while making one&#8217;s final arrangements.In the final five chapters, not only are loose ends tied up regarding one&#8217;s demise, physical changes, the finality of death, and how to grieve are evaluated with Bible verses and spiritual hymns.Knowing all of us will one day die (unless the Rapture occurs first), Rossi encourages caregivers to understand God is in control regarding their loved ones&#8217; souls when they are ushered into eternity.Thanks to Bethany House for furnishing this complimentary book in exchange for a review based on the reader&#8217;s opinion.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Discussing Eternity with the Dying", "unixReviewTime": 1402358400, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2014"}

This was by far the best of the three.  Unlike numerous other books that simply rehash scientific studies, the author breaks down what has been observed and proven in experiments regarding willpower and turns the knowledge into actionable advice that anyone can apply to their life.There are a lot of tactical tips that are sprinkled thoughout the book regarding this.  One for example is that at a moment when you feel like giving up (say not working out, or cheating on your diet), to remember the long-term goal of being in great shape vs the immediate gratification of splurging on bad food.  But to always frame the temptation as a long-term vs short-term question.There are also a number of different justifications that we always tell ourselves, such as &#34;I ran 4 miles today so I deserve a piece of chocolate cake&#34;... The author actually goes through a number of these one by one - and it's interesting because I am guilty of many if not all of these from time to time.  The author explains why each one of these rationalizations sabotage our long-term interests.  The first step is being aware, and the author does a good job bringing visibility to the most common rationalizations of failing willpower challenges.The two activities that have been shown time and time again to increase willpower and overall happiness in life across numerous studies are exercise and meditation.One other part of the book I enjoyed was where the author got into the dichotomy between our 'future selves' and our 'present selves'.  When we think about ourself in the future, we imagine some perfect version of ourselves free of stress and anxiety with more free time and with that version of ourself actually progessing towards our goals.  In reality though, there's no reason why our future self would be any less stressed out or anxious, or would go running 5 miles a day per say, if we're not doing those things now.The author makes an interesting point that your *current* activities define your future self, which seems obvious but is not.  So if you imagine your future self to be living a particular lifestyle or achieving some lofty goals, you need to be taking direct steps towards those things now and not also at some point in the future.Overall this was a great book, I'd highly recommend to anyone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent book", "unixReviewTime": 1400889600, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2014"}

I happen to enjoy his frequent Facebook posts with pictures of icebergs floating by.  That has nothing to do with this book, I just happen to like those pics.As fate would have it, I also happen to like Willie's new book.  Set in his native Scottland, The Exiled, features brothers, John and Alan Grainger.  The former is a copper and the later a cub reporter.They don't really keep in touch until the brutal slaying of a black swan and the simultaneous disappearance of a six-year-old girl bring them together and throw them into a compelling mystery which takes them to a place neither of them even knew existed.  They may not have been close before, but let an outsider try to harm one, the other will give his all for his brother.I loved the mood, the settings, and the colorful language of The Exiled.  I found the story to be original and well written.  &#34;'There's always been stories about these parts,' he said, almost a whisper.  'You can't swing a cat around here without hitting a haunted castle or a fairy wood or a bogle's cave.  There are some things that can't be explained--some things you shouldn't look at too closely.  That's all I'm saying.'&#34;The Exiled is certainly not a pleasant story.  It's horror, plain and simple, with some pretty grim stuff, and the truth is beyond belief.As I was preparing this review, I happened upon the following quote from the author and I thought I'd share...&#34;The nightmare? I've been having it off and on since I was a boy. It's of a bird - a huge, black, bird. The stuff that dreams are made of.In the nightmare I'm on the edge of a high sea cliff. I feel the wind on my face, taste salt spray, smell cut grass and flowers. I feel like if I could just give myself to the wind I could fly. Then it comes, from blue, snow covered mountains way to the north, a black speck at first, getting bigger fast. Before I know it it is on me, enfolding me in feathers. It lowers its head, almost like a dragon, and puts its beak near my ear. It whispers.I had the dream many times, and always woke up at this point.Then, in 1991, I heard what it said.'Will we talk about the black bird?'The next morning, for the first time since 1976, I wrote a story. It wasn't a very good story, but something had been woken up, and the day after that I wrote another, a wee ghost story. It didn't have a black bird in it, but it did have some jazz, and a sultry broad, a murder and some dancing. When that one made me 100 pounds in a ghost story competition, I was on my way.The bird comes back and whispers to me every couple of years - I've come to think of it as my spirit guide. Although it terrifies me, it also reassures me in a weird kind of way. As long as it's around, I'll still be a writer and not just a drunk with weird ideas he can't express.The bird's most recent appearance was last year, and the next morning I had an idea. THE EXILED, my Darkfuse novel is a way of making sense of that dream - I think I got close to the heart of it.Will we talk about the black bird?&#34;The Exiled will be published in paperback and for the Kindle on July 1, 2014 from Darkfuse, a small press that, in my opinion, has become synonymous with quality.Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Horror, plain and simple, with some pretty grim stuff, and the truth is beyond belief.", "unixReviewTime": 1404172800, "reviewTime": "07 1, 2014"}

Paul Jankowski shows his colors even before his text begins by his telling 'in Memoriam', a dedication to the great and greatly under appreciated historian, Richard Cobb.  Respect for the Cobb style or method of doing history plays out in this compelling, nicely written book.Not only was Verdun the longest battle of the Great War, it may be the most interesting. As a place, Verdun was condemned by geography to be both sanctuary and charnel house thousands of years ago. It has natural strategic location as the gateway from what became central France to the Rhineland. It oversaw the best crossing of the Meuse River from pre-Roman times. Unobvious, complex and ambivalent all come to mind when considering the period containing this battle phenomenon.If you are looking for traditional military history play-by-play, this work may disappoint. Jankowski reaches beyond the record, the order-of-battle, to the larger phenomenon that it became to the larger world, then and since. There is some complaining about his Cobbesian approach to history as inappropriate meditation. Jankowski meticulously considers all sources to cobble together the realities of the super-phenomenon of all that was and is Verdun. A simple history of the battle beckons further.\"Legend has its reality, the battle has its own, and the history of the first not only invites the history of the second: it requires it.\", as Jankowski quotes Jean Baptiste Duroselle.This durable historian gives us a well-trodden bibliography that is no mere decoration. His notes lay bare deep scholarship, analysis and consideration.Sapper and tunnel-rat, Jankowski is our best guide to see with German eyes, and then with French eyes; and more, and deeper  through the layers of misplayed mousetraps.

We've all bought/read at least one that had just one good story and the rest sucked. This is How You Die is one of the best subject/idea based anthologies out there, hands down. The stories run from tragic to humourous to horrifying and all points in between. Sometimes you hit all of the notes in the same story. I wasn't super familar with most of the authors involved but in my opinion they really delivered on the subject matter.This book does play on the fears of our own mortality and asks the million dollar question of if you could know how you were going to die would you want to? For me, no I really don't think i would, but the authors in these stories struggle with that question in a believable manner and many different paths were taken. Some chose to know, some ultimately didn't. Some fought their inevitability, some surrendered to it, which is a lot like facing down death from what I've seen in those I've known who knew via illness that their clock was winding down.The simple premise is that a machine will tell you how you will die but not when or where. And while there are a few loopholes, for lack of another term, in the vagueness or off the wall possibilities, it's inevitable, like death itself, that the line printed on your card is true and unavoidable.I can say for myself that I as great as this book was, and as much as I recommend it, I couldn't plow through it. The subject matter is pretty dark even if the authors handle it differently, and even though there is humor, along with the suspense and horror, some of the themes are universal and some very true to life. There are stories in here that made me laugh, and made me cry. A few like the one of the mirror twins, has stuck with me weeks after I read it, and goes down as one of my favorite short stories of all time. So I had to read a story or two here and there versus reading it in one sitting or even inside of one week. Your milage may vary, but even though as I've said the authors do a fantastic job, it's heavy subject matter when we're talking about death and it's inevitability.Highly recommend this one. One of the best anthologies I've ever come across. I don't think you'll be disappointed if short stories and/or theme based anthologies are your thing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Really great and hits every emotion", "unixReviewTime": 1394150400, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2014"}

As we are told this should be every young gentleman's unbridled fantasy. David Worthington, fourth Viscount Fairly, bemoans the fact. Owning a brothel brings a myriad of problems.David's interest in Mrs Letticia Banks is due to her having been the mistress of his deceased brother-in-law, Lord Amery.David needs a Madame, Letticia needs employment. Certainly this looks like a way forward for both of them.Of course, nothing is that simple. As David and Letty are thrown together the attraction between them surfaces. And of course Letty's road to her current state has a sympathetic back story.Oh and yes, 'feet' feature once more in this masterful Lonely Lords addition.  As David and Letty embark on a fuller relationship David reflects, 'he'd touched her feet before, and it seemed a safe--and biblically humble--place to start.' I love the imagery of this line.Douglas Allen, the Viscount of Amery becomes one of my  hero's in his discussion about women with David. No wonder he and David are friends. Two compassionate men, yet both so very different. I have enjoyed them both right from the first moment of meeting them.His confidences to David about Letty reveal the thoughtful depths of the man. Douglas, adorable man, shocks David by suggesting that rather than bed Letty, he David, should marry her. Well that rather takes David aback!I loved it when Douglas describes David as 'an odd duck...a saint by some standards, a lunatic by others.' This is such an apt comment about David.Once more David's medical know come to the fore in relation to Douglas's wife Rose,  her pregnancy and the impending birth. We learn more about David's previous life and marriage.What a wonderful person he is and Letty matches him.The emotions, the sensitivity of David, the sympatico of Letty make for some singularly sweet love scenes, that hum with the very essence of tender love, desire, understanding and appreciation.So why does Letticia want to leave him? Therein is the mystery! A mystery right to the end.I do so love this family, all are as mismatched and charismatic as David's eyes, and I love that they rally in support of each other and stand shoulder to shoulder!A NetGalley ARC", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "David...a masterful Lonely Lords addition!", "unixReviewTime": 1393891200, "reviewTime": "03 4, 2014"}

The event is being held in the ballroom of a local hotel with vendors from all the pastry and  bakery shops from Taos and the surrounding area.  New Mexico will be on a sugar high for days.  The committee that is formed to put the event on seems to be filled with strong personalities that don&#8217;t play well with others especially with a newcomer to the area Carinda Carter who has the ability to rub everybody the wrong way including Sam. One of the girls on the committee is Sarah Williams who was a friend of Bertha Martinez who you recall was the woman who gave that special wooded box with the seemingly magical powers in Sam&#8217;s possession .  With this knowledge Sam is hoping she can get some insight into that box from Sarah.

Meanwhile back at the ranch actually the next ranch over from Beau and Sam&#8217;s ranch Bruce Mulvane&#8217;s signed a contract to allow hippies, flower children and other assorted Peace and Love types to use his land for a festival and Sheriff Cardwell who I still have not warmed up to immediate heads out to the ranch to harass them because we all know hippies are  troublemakers.

I can't believe it, after the s h i t Gray puts her through, but you have to read between the lines and realize that just because Annie is hurting, she isn't without blame herself.

You have two polar opposites who meet at the exact moment that one of their worlds was careening out of focus. Can a new relationship that was born out of chaos ever withstand the light of day? That is the question that we get to explore in the sexy new series by Madelynne Ellis.First we meet Daniella, she is a young 20 year old who has had a rough life. She was raised in a crazy religious commune, where she was severely punished for her love of Black Halo music * A Goth rock band*. But Daniella has thankfully moved out of the commune and started trying to break out of all the rhetoric that was forced on her by all the members of the commune. When we first meet Daniella she is attending a concert of her favorite band. But unfortunately she picked the wrong concert to go to. The members of the band are having a huge fight and break up the band that night. The only bright spot is that she meets her idol, sexy and scary lead singer Xane. She gives him a ride to his bolt hole and things progress from there. With Xane in crisis mode Dani stays with him to offer him solace. She knows how it feels to be wounded, she has loved and listened to Xane's music for a long time. She feels like she knows and shares his pain, surly she can keep her hands to herself and just offer him comfort.Next we meet Xane, he has always lived his life on a razors edge. Raised by nannies and unloved and unwanted by his parents, his only real and lasting relationship is his band. But he was betrayed by 2 of his lovers in the band and no one seems to know how he feels or care how alienated this betrayal has left him. He made the announcement to the band that they were through. He just wants to hide somewhere and get plastered. Everyone better leave him alone. But he needs a ride out of the concert and he sees a cute fan girl eating him up with her eyes. He knows he is using her, but he just doesn't care, she is lucky to drive him where he wants to go....As Xane starts to feel all the pain and emotions bombard him he realizes that the only way to get rid of the memories of an old love is to find a new love. Dani is sexy, and all fans want a piece of him, so they will mutually use each other then walk away.As Dani and Xane start what they think will be a quick fling, they realize that they have a lot of things in common. Xane isn't used to people trying to protect him, and Dani steps into it like she was born just to love him.

Not just with the games I could now play (all night), but about every aspect. I learned every chip on the motherboard, and all the performance data. As time went on, computers improved and got infinitely more complicated, like cars. You used to be able fine tune a car&#8217;s performance. Now it&#8217;s all obscured by electronic components and software. So with the the computer. You really don&#8217;t need to know what chipset has been replaced by an ASIC that does ten times as much in a twentieth of the space. So why do we need to know how the plumbing of the internet works?There are two important reasons. How To Speak Tech demonstrates the current state of complexity and the choices that still need to be made on a daily basis if you are working with tech (as opposed to working in tech, where one should already have internalized all of this and far more). Because it&#8217;s actually still early days, and there are weaknesses, ambiguities and forks in the road. It&#8217;s in the news all the time, and we need to be able to nod our heads knowingly when we read about it. Even just as consumers, we need to know about security, spam, and theft as we roam the internet, and why it&#8217;s taking so long for that stupid page to refresh.Second, and far more important, are working relationships. There is little more frustrating to techies than a marketing person who has zero understanding of what they can and cannot do &#8211; all while making huge demands of them. I leaped over everyone because I could understand what they told me, was able to talk to them in their language, and make suggestions that impressed them because I knew what I was saying. I bridged the engineering-marketing gap. My approaches were intriguing, not just routine, and my requests magically floated to the top of the pile. I was often sent by my employers to deal with prospects&#8217; and customers&#8217; engineers myself. Never failed to blow them away. Trivedi makes it easy for anyone to start down that path.So it not really about &#8220;speaking&#8221; tech; it&#8217;s about internalizing tech. Which programming languages are the most widely used, what are the different kinds of cloud services, what are the strengths and weaknesses of APIs, and what precautions to take to avoid security breaches. The book follows a mythical business as it develops its internet presence.It&#8217;s definitely on the dry side, and could use more colorful stories of successes and failures, but then it&#8217;s more of a reference work than anything else. Thankfully, there is a comprehensive index, so that when someone lets fly with an alien-sounding acronym, you can demystify it in a paragraph, with one click on the link. It reminds me of the Physicians&#8217; Desk Resource &#8211; the bible of drugs.

I love Chloe, but I was a little baffled by her decisions in this book. For the first part of the book they spend a lot of time just living life normally in the Drift and I felt like she should've been spending more time trying to figure out how to rescue their bodies. They were in a serious life or death situation and I felt like they were able to just ignore that a little too much for my liking. Even Alex, who had a little bit of an excuse, should've been more concerned with Chloe's safety at least. Once they took action it got much better though, and by the end I was dying for book 3! (There is an awesome cliffhanger!) I did have a couple more gripes that brought my rating down to a 3 though. For one, I'm not a huge fan of Alex. I don't like that he keeps things from Chloe and I don't think he's been all that helpful so far in solving their issues. I am also still very confused about how their drifting works. I am still hoping that it gets cleared up in the last book, but I had hoped by this point it'd be a little clearer. I'm not sure whether the Drift is really happening or if it's all in her head.

It can be hard to show character growth within the confines of the medium. Lexi Blake has no problem with that in Unconditional. Both Keith and Ashley show a lot of personal growth within the pages of this awesome little novella.Very Brief Synopsis - We met Keith and Ashley in Sanctum, another novella in the Masters and Mercenaries series. Ashley comes to work at Sanctum, the BDSM club owned and operated by various characters we've met in the first 6 novels, when they aren't working for McKay and Taggert Security. Ian Taggert (aka Mephistopheles in Leather) needs a sub to see if Keith is worthy of Master status at Sanctum, and maneuvers Ashley into accepting the task. Ashley and Keith meet under carefully contracted terms, but soon, their attraction for each other grows. Keith has some secrets he is unwilling to share, but is very clear he is far from husband material. Ashley has some issues of her own, which come to light when a man is caught stalking her.What worked - Oh good grief, everything worked here. I LOVED this novella. Keith is so alpha, so in control. Ryan(from Sanctum and Ashley's brother-in-law) calls him compartmentalized, and it is an accurate description. Keith sees Ashley at the club. Period. never mind that he calls her to ask about her classes, or what she had for lunch, or to see how her day is going. In Keith's mind, Ashley belongs in the Sanctum compartment. When he finds out Ashley is being harassed by her baby's grandparents, he is willing to help her, but not provide comfort outside of the club. He has big, big, BIG ghosts haunting him from his past, and is so brittle with his pain...I expected him to shatter with it. And the end, which I will not spoil for anyone, made me cry.Ashley is a single working mom who is also going to school. She is accommodating, and doesn't really stand up for herself. As she becomes Keith's sub, she gains confidence in herself, and starts to speak out, not only in the scenes between her and Keith, but to others, as well. She is devoted to her baby, but wants to have a life for herself, too.As in all of the books in this series, the BDSM parts are handled beautifully. Ms. Blake hints that Sanctum is one of a kind, and that in the real world, a good Dom is much harder to find. Within the confines of Sanctum, the subs really hold all the power, and thrive under the attention from their Doms. Keith teaches Ashley to appreciate herself and to know her own worth. I could feel how much they cared for each other from the beginning.Ian is in rare form, even for Ian. Oh, the funny!!! I think I highlighted every scene he was in. We also had time with Serena and Avery and Charlotte, Jill, Ashley's sister, and Ryan, Jesse, Simon, Damon, Adam...Good, good times.What didn't work - Nothing.Bottom line - This is one freaking terrific series. If you haven't read any of the previous titles, you could start with this one, but do yourself a favor and start at the beginning. Yes, this series is BDSM-centric. The beauty of Ms. Blake's work is how seamlessly she weaves BDSM into the story, and how the psychology of each character explores why they need it without making the whole story revolve around sex and submission/dominance. Yes, there is a lot of sex. Yes, most of the sex is BDSM-related. But there is a ton of other stuff going on as well. These stories are so engaging and engrossing, and then yay! there is hawt as fire sex, too!!! Ms. Blake provides the trifecta of romance, with strong elements of romance, solid plot and wicked, delicious, nasty sex. Loved Unconditional, and can't wait for the next installments to this series.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent novella", "unixReviewTime": 1391385600, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2014"}

The premise is really interesting -- police chief and Episcopalian minister solve crime together -- but the execution is just totally unbelievable and downright silly. This book is neither a true mystery nor a romance and as a result was frustrating and unsatisfying.  It definitely does NOT live up to the hype.The heroine (whose background is awesome - ex-soldier, great cook, chic, educated, etc.) shows such incredibly poor judgment that it totally spoils the story AND makes the hero look like a bumbling idiot.  Seriously, not giving away too many spoilers, but even an airhead wouldn't act on a suspicious message, drive their flimsy car up a snowy mountain without telling anyone where they were going!  And that is just one of the dumb things she does (I won't even mention the dumb conversations with herself, out loud, IN FRONT OF SUSPECTS, deducing who the real perpetrator is!)  This woman is supposed to have been TRAINED in good judgment by the military!  Good grief!The police chief (who is also ex-army and also has a potentially interesting background) is portrayed as someone who just doesn't know how to do his job.  In fact, he comes across as a real incompetent going around arresting every suspect, letting the heroine take the lead when she has no business doing so, discussing things with her that he shouldn't, etc. etc.As for the mystery itself,  with a TSTL heroine and the not-so-smart police chief as the main stars,  the whole thing is just plain silly without any realism.  Though the writing is okay, it is extremely obvious when you are getting &#34;clues&#34; (and it is easy to guess almost at once who the villain is.)I can't recommend this book and I won't be reading an further ones in the series.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Silly Heroine and Not-Too-Smart Hero", "unixReviewTime": 1389052800, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2014"}

I had read the third book first and didn't miss a thing and really enjoyed the book so I decided to give reading Selling Scarlett a chance. This book was very different and not what I was expecting. I loved that Suri and Marchant had popped up a couple of times, it was wierd to hear about thier lives before they met each other.

There so much to love about this books and there were times that I didn't like something but that's okay. Some of the positives for me about this book that I loved the characters. I loved how loyal Libby/Elizabeth/Scarlett was she would do anything for her friends. But that's where one of the negatives for me too because how far would you go for a friend? I think she went too far. She was lucky to have it turned out the way it did. I think that she was very naive and put her self in a lot of situations that could get herself into trouble.Things that didn't seem like much turned out to be clues to what would happen later on in this book. Like times where I thought this book was dragging and useless turned out to be what helped me understand what was going to happen in the future of the book. I loved that there was a lot of suspense and steam. I loved that there was a bit of mystery and that this book wasn't predictable at all.

If I didn't have to do any of that it was in my hands.Worth the Fight - This story is about Elle and Nico. From the minute that she meets Nico you can see the chemistry they have. Elle is living her life in a shell basically. &#34;Dating&#34; her law school friend William. There is no passion there. Even as a reader you are wondering why is she trying to make a relationship, if you can even call it that, with William if there is no real spark. It is totally a friendship with some benefits thrown in. Then William brings in his client for Elle to help consult - Nico - about his contract that he needs to get out of. It was clear that they both felt that vibe and William really didn't stand a chance - not that he wasn't a nice guy but there is no competition.Both Elle and Nico have ghosts that haunt them from their pasts. But together, once they truly open up to each other, they heal one another. Of course their relationship has the usual ups and downs, but they fight for what they have because it is Worth the Fight.I really enjoyed this book.

Abandon is a spin off novel from Cassia Leo's Shattered Heart Series. Who is this story for you ask? Abandon is Tristan and Senia's novel. Before I continue my review can we talk about how hot Tristan is for a minute? Yum is all I gotta say. One may view Tristan as a womanizing a-hole, but he does have charming qualities. Does that even make sense? In my world it sure does!Cassia's talent to evoke so many emotions in one novel is mind blowing. Abandon exhibits raw emotions that entice the reader to feel heartbreaking sorrow, joy, humor, angst, sympathy, and survival.Abandon allows you to learn about Tristan's childhood which really helps you understand who he really is. You are told the secrets of his dark past as well as the issues he is struggling to overcome. The best part is that the timeline for Abandon occurs during the same time frame of Bring Me Home (Shattered Hearts Series #3), which allows you to know what was going on with Senia and Tristan when both characters were not present in the story. In my opinion, this approach adds more to the story as a whole. I LOVED that!At first Tristan and Senia's relationship reminded me of two people that loved to hate each other. Both Tristan and Senia were attracted to each other, but maybe they weren't ready to admit it right away? However their lust for each other was too strong to tame. An unexpected surprise unites their world and causes Tristan to have an epiphany.&#34;The day our wires crossed, You were broken, I was lost.&#34;Is Tristan ready to settle down and dismiss is reckless abandon lifestyle to please the one of the two women he loves and cherishes or will he continue with his wild ways?I will never view these three numbers the same again:&#34;One.

As the first book of The Ascension Series, I thought I was getting in on the first of the series. See, I should have looked before I leaped &#8211; as The Descent Series is the actual first of the series. Now, I have to go back and read that series before I come back to this one.It makes sense now that I was lost throughout the book, though I suppose, stepping back, it was actually quite readable without starting at the very first. It was just that niggling feeling that I was somehow lost in the translation, like I should have known more about the characters, should have had a better feel for the interactions between Elise and the kopis, and Elise and the priest, Father Night. And, of course, the world building seemed off to me, not clarified enough. But, I was so into actually enjoying the book itself, and the unusual world it showed, I didn&#8217;t let it bother me too much. I loved Elise and how different she is as a character, how well developed she is. And the world itself and it&#8217;s mythology? I thought I would just learn more about it as time goes along. And, I have no doubt that, as with many series, if I just read Ascension, I would be fine and happy with the whole thing. It is very interesting, without a doubt.However, I am stopping and going to the first book of the Descent Series, Death&#8217;s Hand and starting over from there. If I am enjoying the story this much without the back-story, how much will I enjoy it with the back-story intact? This is some seriously good storytelling, and it will be well worth going back and starting over. In fact, I am totally excited by the thought! Besides, right now you can get the first three books of the Descent Series, Death&#8217;s Hand, The Darkest Gate, and Dark Union FREE at Amazon as a set: [...] so there is no reason not to start there, right?As I said, Sacrificed in Shadow was quite good on it&#8217;s own. Secrets, betrayal, hatred and love, all embroiled in a dark and sensual story of angels, demons, witches, and wolves. Ultimately, I was quite satisfied with my reading, but will be much more satisfied when I have the first series under by belt, so to say. Being that person who always goes back to read the first books in a series before reading the next to come out, I feel like a kid in a candy store, figuring out the series.

The writing style, even within the individual accounts (father, son, granddaughter) is inconsistent and varies from plodding to wooden with large chunks of dialog written in a pedantically stylized manner (\"I suspect you are mistaken\" (p.421) that bear little reality to any concept of everyday speech patterns. Of course this may be deliberate on the part of the author but comes across as an affectation in much the same way as his irritating habit of interspersing the sections on the Comanche Indians with actual words and phrases from their language without providing any translation. The story, if there actually is one, is weak with a tad too much of poetical metaphysics and abject self pity especially in the wimpy son. This is a pity as the author appears to have spent a lot of time in researching his subject matter. The gory descriptions of Comanche torture are sadistic and formulaic adding little to anything. At times the author moves his wooden speech patterns in the Comanche sections (Eli's story) to a more casual argot that could well be derived from 21st century rap vernacular which is yet another artifice.

I think the heart of this book examines this concept &#8211; how much of our lives are shaped by our actions, vs. the actions of others which affect us? Hayri falls into the Time Regulation Institute (which really only makes its first appearance in the second half of the book) because of who he knows and through a series of misconstrued stories about him others have exaggerated on his behalf.For me, this book was a little bit hard to follow because I am not familiar at all with Turkish culture and the titles they give one another. The title &#8220;Bey&#8221; follows many of the men&#8217;s names and seems to be a title of respect. But that made it hard to keep up with who was who. I found many of the events within the book to be amusing, but I also didn&#8217;t really understand a lot of what was going on.For that reason, I&#8217;m going to limit my recommendation to people who might have an interest in history, or desire to know more about Turkish culture and literature or who enjoy literary fiction and are looking for something different.*A copy of this book was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Limiting My Recommendation", "unixReviewTime": 1398556800, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2014"}

And little did we know that we were playing with a killer...Toni Dwiggins brings that fascination and danger to life in \"Quicksilver\", a novel that, like her previous novel \"Badwater\", mingles mining history, eco-terror and deep knowledge of rocks and human frailties. And, yes, there was plenty of toxic mercury released into the environment in the bad old days of gold mining - but the lure of the gold is still strong, as the characters in this novel make clear.Cassie Oldfield herself is not immune to that lure, nor is her partner Walter Shaw. Yet for the forensic geologists, I believe it is closer to \"The Spell of the Yukon\" as made explicit by Robert W. Service:. There's gold, and it's haunting and haunting,. And it's luring me on as of old;. Yet it isn't the gold that I'm wanting. So much as it's finding the gold.Stunning story, great geology - another winner from Toni Dwiggins!Note: The Dwiggins novel \"Badwater\" is included in the 6-novel set \"Working Girls ...

Conrad GuestMy parents loved watching Formula 1 races on TV, and the sound of cars speeding around the track always takes me straight back to childhood. So does J. Conrad Guest's 500 Miles to Go, which evocatively recreates everything to do with the American USAC , from scary crashes, miraculous survival, pit-stops that always seemed impossibly fast, to, of course, that magical sound as the cars rear around the bends, seemingly ready to fly. I read as drivers jockey for position and expect to see my father, tense in his seat, watching, wondering if the favored car will find a gap. Mum's telling me which driver's honest and which one's going to cheat his way to victory. English names fill me with pride. Foreign ones with memory. And it's just plain fun.Meanwhile, of course, there are drivers living real lives with lost loves, dashed hopes, and off-track arguments. 500 Miles to Go tells the story of one driver's success and separation. \"Lucky in cards, unlucky in love,\" my Gran used to say, but Alex Kr&oacute;l is lucky and skilled in cars, while his love life is more unfortunate.Kr&oacute;l is being interviewed by a newspaper reporter as the story starts. They eat, drink scotch, and smoke cigars; the author recreates the scent of cigar smoke on the air as evocatively as the sense of racing on the track, while the older man teases his interviewer, offering truths and half-truths, before plunging into revealing all. He's lured perhaps by her beauty and her obvious interest. But is she interested in him, or just in her article?There's a wealth of fascinating history in this novel, all told in the voice of a man who lived it and cares. And there's a convincing sense of someone transcribing his words. A sweet love story gives way to the love affair with speed. And cigar smoke offers that sense of slow listening, where interviewees can speak in full paragraphs and tell the tale their own way. First loser becomes disillusioned winner, hindsight waxes philosophical, and a lonely man reminds us \"One doesn't find love... It's not some object to be unearthed... Love is a choice.\"Is losing love a choice as well? As riders seek that median path, how do those of us on life's track avoid being overtaken?I started to enjoy this story for its evocative depiction of racing cars.

I instantly took a liking to Sarah, not only for her obsessive passion and love for all things books but because I could relate to her in so many wonderful ways. Sarah has always stayed in Ashford, never daring to venture too far out into the big, wide world, completely happy with her nose stuck in a good romance book, her eyes flirting with the dreamy words printed onto the pages. Sarah looked upon her bookshop with a maternal and affectionate love, often referring to the books inside as her 'babies', which is something that I do on a day-to-day basis! At any time when the talk of adventure or change would crop up, Sarah would retreat back into her fictional world, perfectly happy with her lot.&#34;Change was so alien to me, it was almost another language. I was a staunch fan of the 'if it's not broke - don't fix it' mentality.&#34; ~ SarahIt was hard for me to not read about Sarah and not see myself in her personality and characteristics. I guess you could say that she was a little child-like in some aspects, again, like myself. Sarah found the fictional world within the pages of a book a million times better than anything that reality had to offer. She dreamed of the dashing, heroic men that she read about in the piles and piles of books stacked up in her bookshop, she dreamed of the passionate, heart-pounding love that only fictional characters would ever be lucky enough to have. Put simply, Sarah Smith was a dreamer, living in her fictional world, drinking coffee and just living her (albeit fairy-tale like) never-changing life. I do believe that Sarah and I would be the best of friends if she was a real person. We're so alike it's uncanny. Another point that I feel I need to touch upon is that Sarah decides to start up a blog. Yes! A real, true-to-life blog. HOW AMAZING IS THAT? See?! We've got to be related! I absolutely LOVED the added blog aspect, it gave me a little thrill to know that I was also a blogger. Rebecca thought of everything, she really truly did. I was just astounded.Another character that I took a particular liking to in The Bookshop On The Corner was one of Sarah's closest friends Missy. One word came to my mind when Rebecca first introduced Missy to me and that word was 'diva'. Not diva in a bad way, but diva in a sassy, curvaceous, exhilarating way. I just loved the way that Rebecca described Missy.&#34;Her form-fitting scarlet dress lit up the sepia-toned shop. She was all bouffant auburn curls, and thick Hollywood-esque make-up, and the type of person that made you smile just by setting eyes on her.&#34;Missy is also the owner of The Sassy Salon that sat on the corner just opposite The Bookshop On The Corner, so I was instantly given an image of this chatty, gorgeous woman who was loved by everyone and always had something exciting to talk about, no matter how dreary or grey the weather was outside. I really adored the way Missy seemed to brighten up Sarah's life. I mean, Sarah was clearly not depressed or sad about her lot in life, but whenever Missy entered the shop she seemed to leave a ray of sunshine and sparkle in her wake, and Sarah seemed to smile constantly. The relationship between these two was what every girl should have. Missy was Sarah's go-to when she needed advice, and a lot of the time Missy would hand out advice and comments whether Sarah asked her to or not, but not in an over-bearing way. Just in a way that said, &#34;I'm your girl, and I'll be here for you no matter what.&#34; Missy was bursting to the brim with personality and goodness, and such a wonderful addition to Rebecca's characters.Rebecca also uses one of my favourite techniques in The Bookshop On The Corner. If you have read any of her previous novels and met Lil and CeeCee then you will see more of them when you read The Bookshop On The Corner. I absolutely LOVE when authors do this. I don't know about you but when you read a fantastic book and then have to say goodbye to the characters it can sometimes leave you feeling a little lost and sad. I find myself with an urge to catch up with them and see what's going on in their lives. In The Bookshop On The Corner, this is the perfect chance to do that. Lil and CeeCee from the Gingerbread Cafe appear in the story on more than one occasion and I was delighted when I heard their names being mentioned. In The Bookshop On The Corner, The Gingerbread Cafe is right opposite Sarah's haven and every now and again, she'll glimpse through the window and catch Lil and Damon canoodling. Sarah, Missy, CeeCee and Lil are a close, tight-knit bunch of friends and their chats over gingerbread milkshakes and all matters of yumminess really warmed my heart. Seeing characters from previous novels getting on with their lives just makes it all seem so much more real and magical, and I enjoyed it to no end.Another thing that I felt a strong desire to comment on was Sarah's bookshop itself. I want to work there so badly. It's like a book lover's paradise. Its not one of those pristine, modern, grey interiors, but aged, enchanted and sprinkled with fairy dust. That is honestly how I felt about Sarah's bookshop. Rebecca's descriptions of the book shop were impeccable, describing to me a place that I have always wanted to visit but never knew existed.&#34;I turned back to the inside of the shop to watch shards of muted sunlight settle on piles of books, as if it were slowly waking them. The haphazard stacks seemed straighter, as if they'd decided when I wasn't looking to neaten themselves up, dust their jackets off, and stand to attention.&#34;Never before have I seen books be brought to life like this. Rebecca instilled a true fascination within Sarah's character that made her look upon the hundreds of books in her shop as though they were real people. I felt like I was in a dream-like state because of the way Rebecca drew me in with her delicate and quaint descriptions. Everything about Sarah's bookshop sang to me. It's exactly how I would choose to have my own bookshop if I ever had that opportunity. Books stacked to heights taller than me, books lying gracefully here and there. It was a pure delight to be invited inside of such a beautiful, ethereal place.Rebecca could not have chosen a more perfect moment to introduce Ridge to Sarah. Ridge Warner was heavenly in every sense of the word. Tall, dark and brooding, Ridge is a New York reporter sent to do a piece on Sarah's tiny little town of Ashford after he visited during the Chocolate Festival. (You can read about the chocolate festival in Chocolate Dreams at the Gingerbread Cafe) Bizarrely, Ridge was exactly how Sarah imagined her book-heroes to be; absolutely delectable, just like the sweet treats from The Gingerbread Cafe. I loved him. Loved, loved, loved him! He was charming, very dashing and every inch the disarming fictional book-boyfriend. Rebecca kept me guessing from the moment that Ridge entered the scene. I was excited to see where the story was going to go from here, and I was not disappointed.The Bookshop On The Corner is written with the same fluidity that can be found in all of Rebecca's previous titles. Her smooth, perfectly structured sentences allow for a pleasurable read. No hitches, no plot-holes and not a single thing that I would change, The Bookshop On The Corner is a staggering addition to Rebecca's creations. Every nook and cranny was brought to life in Sarah's little bookshop, every fleck of dust commented upon, every book alive and breathing. I am gob-smacked at the amount of creativity and phenomenal imagery that I have found in this title. Rebecca has left no stone un-turned, creating the perfect small-town woman just dreaming of her own happy-ever-after. I found an immense amount of pleasure in reading The Bookshop On The Corner. In fact, I read it in one sitting and slept peacefully once I was finished. Rebecca sprinkles her stories with such charm and delicacy that I feel like I'm bouncing on big, fluffy clouds.Becca's Books is giving The Bookshop On The Corner a befitting rating of five glorious cupcakes. This story is every book lovers dream. Rebecca has brought the hidden depths of a book lovers mind to the surface and unearthed all of our bookish secrets that normally we would keep to ourselves. This story couldn't be anymore perfect if it tried. I am in love with Rebecca's characters, the heart-warming connection between them all and the intertwined lives within the tiny town of Ashford.

I found that she was indeed a prosecutor for LA County and was in fact quite well know for a specific trial which I had followed.  From that point on I could see a difference in the writing style that was very obvious.  Instead of the hazy references that a non lawyer would make, the details were very real and made the story much more interesting.  From that point on I was so engrossed that I could hardly put it down.  The feel of the story and the characters took on this real life stance and I could see the subtle differences between the two.  Also this takes place in LA of which I am quite familiar so that made it even better.What did I like?  The lead character Rachel Knight!  I found her to be a real down to earth person that was very dedicated to her job (maybe a little to much for her own good) but you could see that making a difference was important to her.  She was serious to a fault but yet so humorous.  I had to laugh so many times and other times I could feel the empathy that she had.  She had her dedication but yet she bucked the system that put so many restraints on her, making her all that much more real.  I loved her friends and her strengths but at the same time I could feel her doubts and weaknesses.  She is the kind of person that you would want for a friend. Thankfully I do have friends like her.What did I dislike?  That is a good question, I found the story entertaining but yet disturbing.  I guess I would have to say Ms Clark took a very disturbing real life problem and showed that it can be handled to the best of what the system will allow it to be taken care of.  Child abuse and child porn turns my stomach and I do not think that there is a person on earth that would like that.What will you like?  A story that is VERY WELL developed, humorous, very serious, heartbreaking, sad but yet happy, and so full of twists and turns that you will stayed glued to the pages.  The characters are so human and endearing.  Action packed with vivid details and descriptions bringing the story alive with all of the real life type of events that will touch your heart.  Lots of quirky humor that will tickle your bones.  A lead character that has a true sense of herself including her faults.  Come on who would not like a pistol packing DA that uses the system to get the best justice that she can bring about.  Marcia Clark has a winner in this book and I will definitely look forward to her next one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "LA - DA!", "unixReviewTime": 1404950400, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2014"}

Henri Nouwen clearly sets out the premise of his little book in his introduction: &#8220;For all ministers are called to recognise the sufferings &#8230; in their own hearts, and to make that recognition the starting point of their service&#8230;.our service will not be perceived as authentic unless it comes from a heart wounded by the suffering about which we speak.&#8221;The first half of the book describes a suffering world and a suffering generation. Because Nouwen wrote the book in the 1970&#8242;s, this part does appear quite dated and perhaps not very relevant to us. He talks about people rejecting authority and turning instead to drugs and mysticism, or to a revolutionary way. He suggests that Christianity is the third way which incorporates both mysticism and revolution. He promotes compassion as the essential quality for effective leadership. In his definition of compassion is included the concept of tolerance, &#8220;For a compassionate person, nothing human is alien: no joy and no sorrow, no way of living and no way of dying.&#8221;The second half of &#8220;The Wounded Healer&#8221; is what really resonated with me. Nouwen gives an example of a young theology student whose task is to minister to a man who is frightened of dying during an operation. The student uses techniques he has learnt in class, such as reflective listening, but does not manage to give any comfort to the sick man. The man does die in the operation, and Nouwen states that this is because he had nothing to live for. He goes on to explain that what the man needed was for someone to become his brother, someone who would wait for him. &#8221;I will wait for you&#8221; says Nouwen &#8220;goes beyond death and is the deepest expression of the fact that faith and hope may pass, but love will remain forever.&#8221;The rest of the book puts across the argument that anyone who wishes to minister to others is required to enter into communion with human suffering in order for relief to be found. &#8220;Those who proclaim liberation are called not only to care for their own wounds and the wounds of others, but also to make their wounds into a major source of healing power.&#8221; He says that rather than escape our own suffering, it is when we have a deeper understanding of it, that our weakness is turned into strength and we are able to help others.Nouwen speaks of hospitality as being a withdrawal of self in order to make room for another person to come in and express who they are. Ministers do not have the task of taking away the pain, but rather to allow it to be felt and understood, so that it can be accepted &#8220;as an expression of the basic human condition.&#8221;  This shared weakness is the beginning of community, which in turn leads to hope.For anyone considering ministering to others, this is an essential book.

Harvey, who was active as a major league umpire from 1962 &#8211; 1992, has been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, and been voted the second best umpire, behind Bill Klem, of all time. The book is filled with Harvey's assessment of ball players, managers, and fellow umpires based largely on their deportment on and off the field as well as the degree to which they easily bent themselves to his enormous will and sense of himself. Players and managers who learned not to argue or to do so according to Harvey's set of rules come off looking pretty good, while those who gave him a great deal of difficulty are hammered. Similarly, umpires who bent to his or agreed with his standards for umpiring come across as being good officials, although none but a couple of his mentors ever measure up to him. Harvey's egotism and his sense of his own correctness dominate the book. He frequently asserts his fairness and his willingness not to carry grudges, while his stories emphasize the cost to players, managers, and the game of his propensity to get even. I'm unsure whether these marked contrasts represent his lack of self-awareness or the depth of his hypocrisy.Doug Harvey grew up in the poverty of the Imperial Valley of California during the great depression. His father worked hard to maintain a hard-scrabble existence. Young Doug often went with him as he umpired amateur and minor league games, while excelling in athletics himself. He was sometimes asked to serve as an umpire, earning small amounts of money doing so. He attended college on an athletic scholarship, but was unable to finish due to an injury and early, doomed marriage. He always worked hard, and, with increasing frequency umpired baseball and refereed basketball, at the college and minor league level, eventually rising to higher levels as his first marriage dissolved. Eventually, he rose to the major leagues after several years umpiring in Mexico and Puerto Rico as well as the AAA California League  league. He became a major league umpire in 1962, jumping  over several senior hopefuls as one of the last umpires not to attend umpire school. Read the rest of this review on my blog.

Johnny Horowitz is an alcoholic paparazzi, and he'll do anything for a story, and while driving by the deserted North Beach on Seagull Island, when he feels it calling to him, and Johnny has made his living by listening to his inner voices.  So, he goes down to see what it is about the North Beach that is so special.  And after looking around, he finds bones, human bones, and then he really smells a story when he goes to the local law, and he finds that they have absolutely no stomach for any investigation into the matter.  At all.A good story means good money, and Johnny needs money, so he stakes out the beach to see what he can see.  And what he sees is a sea monster attack, and then he realizes that he is seeing even more than that, that there is even something more special to the beach than the occasional monster.  Something that might have to do with time slippages.Enter Matt Packard, the local historian who knows more about the beach than nearly anybody else, and since he is nearing the end of his life, he doesn't give a damn anymore about screwing up Seagull Island's tourist trade, or whose feathers get ruffled.  Just the type of person Johnny needs, and wants on his side.Johnny also finds out that these incidents and attacks only take place during periods of great atmospheric disturbances, like hurricanes, like hurricane Amelia, like hurricane Amelia which is barreling on down on Seagull Island.With the novella \"Leviathan\", Tim Curran delivers another slab of neo-pulp \"B\" movie action goodness that starts out with Curran developing his situations, locals, and characters, Johnny is a prime screw-up, and he's the type of person who gets people killed.  Curran will then have the story move inexorably towards its exciting, and nearly apocalyptic ending, which happens during Amelia's worst, as the past come back to bite Johnny, Matt, and the whole island, in more ways  than one.This is a novella that could have appeared, if only slightly revised, in many of the old thirties or forties pulp adventure or fantasy magazines, before sf started taking itself way too seriously.  What a great movie this novella would make, especially the ending, which is one of the best and most exciting that I've read in fiction in some time, and which oddly enough, reminded me of the ending of the mystery thrillerSkiptraceby Antoinette Azolakov with its equally exciting hurricane, although in a different way, ending.And once again, Severed Press refuses to list or acknowledge who does the cover artwork for their books; I'd like to know just who did the artwork for this novella, it's pretty danged good.For this site I have also reviewed these other books by Curran:Cannibal Corpse, M/Cby Tim Curran.Dead Seaby Tim Curran.The Hive #1:Hive (The Hive Series)by Tim Curran.The Hive #2:The Spawning: Book Two of The Hive Seriesby Tim Curran.Skin Medicineby Tim Curran.Also of interest are these books:Blood Hunterby Sidney Williams.Crogianby John Leahy.Deeperby James A.

This book is a 'Heartsong Presents' book, and I will say it again this book has some meat to it, where I rely on 'Heartsong Presents' books being more candy then a meal, this book is a meal in of itself.  It is not often that I give a 'Heartsong Presents' book a five star rating but this book really deserves it.So much is happening that I just found myself completely lost in the book.  Our heroine Sarah Anne Rycroft is a woman who is not willing to give up without a fight.  She is also a woman who is fighting some pretty big issues within herself but that didn't stop her gentle spirit shining through.Then our hero, T.J. O'Brien, is a man of God, but I loved how he was also a man.  T.J. is out there riding the circuit because of his calling, not wanting to get married, and liking that he only stays in one town for a short period of time then he can leave before a 'noose' is placed over his head by a mamma of a marriageable young lady.  His humor is subtle at times, but his caring for everyone is there to be seen by all.The story is well told with characters that are well rounded with back-stories that made my heart ache more for one of them then the other.  I have seen characters who have questioned, doubted and been angry at God in books before but I found that the character here that was so angry, when they fell flat on their face trying to go at it alone, they really fell flat on their face in the worse of times, and somehow because of that this scene was poignant to me.  It was a great reminder that frankly when we can't stand anymore that we can pray no matter where, what condition we are in and that frankly we will be loved even after yelling our hearts out.  This scene showed me that frankly God doesn't move away from us but that we move away from Him, and He is always waiting for us with arms open wide.There is another scene on page 95 where there is a discussion on family, somethings were said that really made me wonder.  It was such a unique way of looking at God and Jesus as the head of a family, but at the same time it made a lot of sense as well.  I doubt if I will be able to forgot that dialogue of the scene anytime soon.  I love when books strike me like that with something that I won't be able to forget anytime soon if at all.I truly hope all that read this book enjoys it as much as I did.

How do solidify our sense of who we are if we don&#8217;t know where we came from?  In what ways can we take our place in the universe if our knowledge of our past is incomplete?Kit Noonan has reached a fork in the road.  Underemployed with no clear sense of purpose, he is floundering, until his wife urges him to take some time away to work out the secret of his father&#8217;s identity. That search leads him back to his stepfather Jasper in Vermont &#8211; a self-sufficient outdoorsman who effectively raised him along with two stepbrothers. Eventually, the journey brings him to Lucinda, the elderly wife of a stroke-ravaged state senator and onward to Fenno (from Julia Glass&#8217;s first book) and his husband Walter.Through all this, Kit discovers the enigma of connections and which connections prevail.  As one character states, &#8220;..the past is like the night: dark yet sacred. It&#8217;s the time of day when most of us sleep, so we think of the day as the time we really live, the only time that matters, because the stuff we do by day somehow makes us who we are. We feel the same way about the present&#8230;. But there is no day without night, no wakefulness without sleep, no present without past.&#8221;The biggest strength of this novel &#8211; by far &#8211; is the beautifully rendered portrayal of characters.  Kit, Jasper, Lucinda and her family, Feeno and Walter &#8211; even Kit&#8217;s twins &#8211; are so perfectly portrayed that they could walk off the pages.  As a reader, I cared about every one of them and &#8211; as the book sequentially goes from one character to another &#8211; I felt a sense of loss from temporarily leaving him or her behind.The only weakness was an overabundance of detail (scenes, back story, etc.), which robbed me of using my imagination to &#8220;fill in the blanks.&#8221; While vaguely discomforting, this story is so darn good and the writing is so darn strong that I was glad to be immersed in its world for the several days I was reading.

With that being said, I am soooooo glad that I didn't let a few reviews, negative I might add, keep me from reading this book. When I first read the novella, With You, I had no idea the direction this story was going to take.I have never read a book that provided an inside view of the gruesome and violent world of human trafficking and sex slavery. It is a world that exists and this story provided a glimpse into it. To say my heart broke for Emily when she was abducted and then discovered Sculpt's involvement is truly an understatement. But through it all, all is not what it seems. Emily survived because Sculpt made it so.Now, fast forward two years and Emily has barely put herself back together. This is the point of the book where I did agree with a couple of the other readers where they became a little upset with Emily and her inability to accept Sculpt's role in what happened to her. But when she does.......MAN! The love that Logan has for Emily, she can finally feel, see and accept. She realizes that while he takes control of her, he gives her what she needs. He was always what she wanted him to be......her knight.My suggestion to you if you are thinking about reading this book.........READ IT! You won't be disappointed. Are there some dark elements in this story that will make you cringe and possibly cry? Absolutely.

Picking up a year after the original story, book two of the series, The Harlot&#8217;s Tale, returns to the tumultuous streets of York, where Bridget, Martha and Will must race to discover who is sending the city&#8217;s sinners to their final judgment.Before I get too far ahead of myself, I want to make it clear that while The Harlot&#8217;s Tale can be read independent of its predecessor, the book is best appreciated as a follow-up. Thomas provides all necessary information for those readers who might have missed his 2013 debut, but there is a lot to be said for the nuance and subtle detail built on the foundation of the original which is why I highly recommend reading the series in chronological order.Take for example, Thomas&#8217; setting. Under siege in 1644, York felt like a city under occupation with its rhythms dominated by military order. A year later, York has fallen into Puritan hands and is utterly transformed by dogmatic conflict. Thomas&#8217; ability to first recreate seventeenth century York and then convincingly reinvent his fiction is nothing short of extraordinary, but the effort wouldn&#8217;t be noticed by those who&#8217;d skipped the first installment.Also of note is Thomas' cast and how he successfully avoided the situational and personal drama he highlighted in The Midwife&#8217;s Tale. These are the same characters, but they&#8217;ve grown with the passage of time and that progression has wrought slight changes to their personalities as well as the role each plays in the larger story. There is a certain degree of familiarity here, but Thomas moves the story forward, effectively balancing the interests of new readers against those of his established fans.Like its predecessor, I didn&#8217;t feel the mystery particularly enigmatic, but that being said, I liked how it played out. Despite having correctly identified the culprit in the early stages of the novel, I remained engaged in the narrative and greatly enjoyed watching the details come to light.A vividly atmospheric and action-packed historical, The Harlot's Tale is a deliciously alluring fiction that cleverly combines doctrine, disorder and death in a single irresistible volume.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Harlot's Tale", "unixReviewTime": 1389830400, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2014"}

Regarding more recent novels (of the 21st century), no heroine has enchanted me quite so much as Teresita Urrea of THE HUMMINGBIRD&#8217;S DAUGHTER (even if she is from a different century). That is, until Rachman&#8217;s Tooly Zylberberg. All my favorite fictional females are inimitable, and destined to be copied by later writers &#8212;iconoclasts that in later years become icons.Tooly possesses that natural charisma and disarming independence that distinguishes an unforgettable character&#8212;a woman that desires love, but dares to live outside its chambers. Too smart to dumb down, she&#8217;s a titanic presence in a diminutive frame, who often feels there&#8217;s no niche where she belongs. She concedes that she doesn&#8217;t know where she&#8217;s from; she&#8217;s on a journey to discover who she is-- literally.At 32, Tooly (Matilda) lives above the money-losing bookshop business that she owns in a centuries old former pub (which she rents) in a tiny mountainside village in Wales. There are so few people who live in this isolated berg that it would be all but impossible to keep it afloat with customers. Her one employee is Fogg, his name an obvious ironic allusion to Phileas Fogg in Verne&#8217;s AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS. Rachman&#8217;s Fogg, who travels thousands of miles in books, never leaves this miniscule village, but develops an imaginary parallel life as a globe-trotting academic and Francophile. He&#8217;s a contemplative fellow who feels a kinship to Tooly.&#8220;We&#8217;re like a lost tribe, people like us&#8230;No traditions, no birthright&#8230;All of us have an acorn of sadness&#8230;You notice our tristesse, only in passing, like a door to a small room in a house where outsiders may not enter.&#8221;Other than Fogg, and a music teacher that coaches her in ukulele lessons, Tooly&#8217;s link with other people are limited to those in the literature that she reads. She is largely an autodidact, who received a boost in education as a child, when she met an aging Russian, a poor and hermetic scholar and consultant for wealthy book collectors named Humphrey, whose English is full of charming malapropisms. Humphrey introduced her to the finest minds on the printed page.Tooly&#8217;s life was an aggregation of never-ending voyages-- a disrupted childhood of itinerant adventures with alternate caregivers and one enigmatic, and increasingly apparitional, avuncular figure named Venn. Venn was all-points latitude and longitude, the vortex on which all her emotional life was conveyed. But, for a decade now, he seemed to have dropped off the earth. The one constant companion in her life was literature, especially Dickens&#8217; Nicholas Nickleby, which she had read countless times.Rather than lay out the entire plot and all the juicy characters, I would rather persuade you to just open this book and travel back and forth in diverse countries and various decades&#8212;1988, 1999, 2000, and 2011, including several chapters headed with beginnings, middles, and ends in backwards order. All this anarchic time is not without purpose, however. The story develops as the pieces and people influential in Tooly&#8217;s life are revealed in measured moments and junctures. Tooly mines the seminal events in her life, delving into her biological heritage and her inclination to repeatedly uproot.Rachman&#8217;s prose is nothing less than delicious, with quotable passages and phrases and superbly captured settings. The tone and voice is warm, wry, tender, and even scalding at times. It is tied together organically, not one disingenuous moment in this story. Even as Tooly is beguiled, she is the most beguiling of all. Her artless social skills are offset by a learned ability to cross thresholds, both mental and physical.&#8220;It was intoxicating, the unholy control of another human&#8230;--engineering another&#8217;s fate was not necessarily destructive.&#8221;", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Intoxicating--this is why I read!", "unixReviewTime": 1402963200, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2014"}

In the midst she brings together Ben and Olivia.  Ben is a reluctant commander, newly appointed to the position.  Olivia is a lawyer more focused on the legalities of justice than the reality of being human.  A classic case of opposites attract.  Their differing viewpoints make them interesting to watch.  Trust is hard won with these two, but they clearly earn it and the payoff is worth it.I have to admit, I didn&#8217;t really like Olivia.

It was in an amazing combination of steaminess, suspense, and intrigue.  This was my first book by this author and I can truly say that I am hooked. I found myself engrossed in her writing and never got bored and skimmed through pages, which is a rarity for me.  I loved Marley's strength and vulnerability. I thought that the author did a great job showing how a person struggles to heal after devastating events. Some authors tend to skim over the internal battles that a person with a damaged past goes through, but Ms. Prince did a superb job of pulling the reader in so that they feel the characters' pain. Gabriel had me swooning over him from his first appearance, and I loved that we were able to see things from his POV throughout the book.  Nothing in this book felt over-exaggerated or far fetched, which I appreciated.  I hope that these two can find their happily ever after because they truly deserve it.

Yet it lacks the soul of the female lead that JCO renders in such vivid hues (for example, Anellia in \"I'll Take You There\").Now \"Back to Blood\" would seem to be Wolfe's riff on Carl Hiaasen.  He must have thought he could do it better.  But Wolfe does not come close to the Miami Herald reporter's assiduously plotted romps through the land- and cityscape of rogues, crooked politicos and good (if unbalanced) guys who hunger for justice.Where Hiaasen's work rarely contains a wasted word, let alone plot twist, Wolfe delivers Miami's elite and vile mixing it up in a rambling foray some 700 pages long (I hope Little, Brown recouped their $10,000 per page investment).  The story is told primarily through the eyes of two Cubanos desperate to escape their home town Haileah, though for different reasons. It is punctuated with many lurid sex scenes including repeated references to one character's Herpes pustule-covered member.  (One visual of that will suffice.)  A late Act II's scene in a strip club does nothing to advance the plot or further character development, nor does the next sequence, a belabored slog through a senior housing complex where a Vodka-soaked Russian art forger hides from harm.  This was the juncture at which it seemed wise to skitter through the last 250 pages to learn the outcome.  A multitude of subplots and characters were abruptly dropped.Wolfe's novel contains its share of clever moments, but even the trenchant satire is so overwritten that the juiciest passages wear themselves thin.  This author's role in the development of \"New Journalism\" is undeniable.  He has my admiration for his thorough research into his subject matter; in fact, the authentic feel of Cuban-American culture may stem from as far back as his early stint with the Washington Post when he reported briefly from that country.  But in this as in other novels, Wolfe fails to write a single primary character that is not obsessed with how he or she is perceived by others.If readers are looking for a beautifully crafted novel that whirls around a crystalline perspective, this story will not satisfy, and it affirms Wolfe's place somewhere below the top tier of American authors.  If he is determined to out-write one of our best-known novelists, he may do well to pick one who possesses more middling talent.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Self-indulgent, poorly plotted burble of the narcissist class", "unixReviewTime": 1392854400, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2014"}

I read it in its infancy and looked forward to each new book.Now, we get a little peek into the space between the books. In KEEPER, a novella, we get the origins of Kira's extraordinary speed and strength--reactions she is able to trigger by &#34;jacking&#34; or manipulating her own brain.Kira was able to &#34;jack&#34; herself to some extent in Open Minds and Closed Hearts, but for Free Souls she has the unique skill to trigger adrenaline release in her body enabling her to travel at superhuman speeds and act with superhuman strength. It's a valuable skill to have.Also, we get to see Julian, leader of the Jacker Freedom Alliance, up close and personal. It's clear that Kira struggles with her attraction to Julian--not sure if it's real or a memeory remnant from the time he jacked her mind. Well, I'm sure it's real; no man is so possessive of a woman without having some emotional bond to her.In KEEPER, Kira's obsessed with being on the strike force for the next JFA mission: attacking Kestrel's stronghold and rescuing trapped jackers from experiments and torture. Julian won't let her go knowing that Kira's secondary objective is to kill Kestrel--and it's clear Julian doesn't want Kira in harm's way. So, Kira develops her new talent in secret, hoping to make herself invaluable as a strike force member.It doesn't all go down so well, but maybe Julian will learn to relax.... Yeah.

Peterson's 100th novel, A Sensible Arrangement is a well crafted historical romance with a Christian slant that will have readers clamoring for more. It is the first book in the new Lone Star Brides series and brings together two people who have a lot more in common than meets the eye. Weaving two great themes together, a mail order bride and a marriage of convenience, Peterson gives readers a novel that easily become a favorite.What I liked:Tracie Peterson is probably one of my favorite Christian/Inspirational authors. Though she has written 100 novels, I did not find her until a few short years ago. But once I did, I devoured the books she has written with great gusto. That sometimes happens when I find an author I feel like I can really connect to and understand. I am a former history major and historical detail is often very important to me in reading this kind of novel. Peterson is one of the best at making history come alive for her readers. She knows just the right elements to add to give each of her books the right balance between romance and history and A Sensible Arrangement is a great example of that.Marty was a heroine that I truly enjoyed. She was a very capable and nurturing woman, with a loving spirit. She had seen tragedy in her life, but was able to withstand and grow. But she needed change. Her husbands death on the ranch was tragic and affected her so deeply that she wanted to leave that life behind. Who wouldn't? She didn't want to be reminded on a daily basis of what she had lost. I thought Peterson did a great job with the character and that she made her easy to relate to and understand.Jacob is a man who acquired a very upstanding position on a Denver bank, but it requires attending a lot of social functions. His employers feel that he must be married in order to continue in his position. He hasn't had the best of luck when it comes to love and he doesn't want all the entanglements that go with it, so he decides to advertise for a bride. Knowing he wants to return to his love of ranching in Texas one day, he stipulates that he is looking for a Texas bride. I thought Peterson portrayed Jake as a man on mission. He wants to return to Texas, but in order to do that he needs a wife. He doesn't need a lover. I liked how determined he was and that both he and Marty are flawed. Nobody's perfect and it's a good thing too!I loved all of the historical detail that Peterson weaves into this story. Colorado at the time of this book was up and coming with Denver as a major city and it's opulence and grandeur can easily be seen in Peterson's writing. The circumstances surrounding the repeal of the Silver Act and the political and social climate of the times was very well documented and Peterson uses it to her advantage. The best part of the book for me was the detail and description Peterson gives to the setting and the times. Very well done.I also truly enjoyed the romance aspect of this book. Marty and Jake don't realize that by leaving out some of their own desires, they are compromising their relationship. Yes, it is a marriage of convenience, but trust is still so important in making any kind of marriage work. Marty wants nothing more to do with Texas, and the desire of Jake's heart is to return there. Keeping these facts from each other nearly destroys the possibility of real love for them and Peterson certainly makes it intense. This part of the book was realistic and believable. The characters were flawed and imperfect and redeemable.The Christian themes were not preachy or overwhelming either. There was just the right balance to add to the flavor of the book. Peterson focuses on anger at God in this novel, through Marty's anger over the death of her husband. It was interesting to watch her fight against her own feelings to get back to a place where she loved and trusted God. Peterson did a great job with this aspect of the book as well.What I didn't like:Jake was very intense in his desire to return to Texas as a rancher. But I didn't feel like Marty had that same kind of intensity in her own desires. She eventually takes on the task of helping orphans which fills a place in her heart for children and that was a very good way for her to have purpose, but it is not one of the main themes of the novel and comes across as less important. I think more importance on this part of the book would have been nice.Bottom Line:This is a very well written Christian historical romance. There are few authors in this genre that really satisfy the historical elements for me and Peterson is definitely one of the best. I'm glad this is the first novel in a new series, because I enjoyed it very much and look forward to more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Sensible Arrangement by Tracie Peterson", "unixReviewTime": 1397260800, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2014"}

He made me hot, made me smile, made me cry and damn near gave me a heart attack. He was perfection.I liked Rachel, I really did. The women in these novels are just different. I think there is something to be said for the way sex and love and affection are handled in these novels. I only wish I was articulate enough to explain it. It just means that the women are strong and brave and whole in a way that is missing quite often from other female characters.Cruz, and I love Cruz so don't misunderstand, that man can boss me around anytime, but I think it was something in his perspective that was lacking, something about being in his head that just wasn't quite enough.I love a good threesome, of course. I loved the M/F/M, I wish we had had more than the one and a half M/M scene and more than the one M/M/F scene, but I think the M/M/F was well- placed.I appreciated that there was some insecurity and twinges of jealousy and feelings of being...maybe not left out, but not entirely &#34;included&#34;, but to me that made it more realistic. It came from each of them at one point or another as well, though most heavily with Ace.There was something about the three of them coming together that was freeing for each of them in some capacity, they felt safe enough and had enough trust with each other to really let go and do what they wanted.And it was hot...like panty-drenching, set the mattress (or tattoo chair or stage) on fire hot. I wanna be marked by Ace.There was a ton of other stuff going on as well, we get to see the characters from the previous books, there is still unrest in the sectors, shady things going on, etc. and a build up for some of the next books as well.Overall 4 starsWould recommend to fans of the series and fans of menageWill read more from this author", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "very good", "unixReviewTime": 1405641600, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2014"}

He is a successful owner of a big time gaming enterprise and has no past problems with wanting full control of everything. However, that need for control and lack of trust may be what ends the love between him and Mia. After reuniting and making a commitment to one another, Adam sticks with his plan to hike the Rocky Mountains for 5 weeks. The long sabbatical confirms he needs Mia in his life and she belongs to him.However, their short honeymoon of being in a happy relationship comes to an end when Mia begins receiving acceptance letters to medical schools. He does not want to let her go because he feels he will lose her like he lost his sister to her addiction. The lack of trust and willing to compromise scares Mia to the point where she reconsiders their relationship.Sadly, the choice of medical school becomes a distant concern when Mia shuts Adam off completely. She is constantly tired, sick, and won't talk to Adam. His fear of losing her forces him to make bad decisions in order to find out her problems and needs. Of course, Mia finds out about his overbearing ways and finds it even more difficult to trust him. His fear of losing her becomes a reality when he can't listen yo her needs and realizes it might be too late.For my Goodreads friends, this is the second book of a trilogy.

Yet again my curiosity did get the best of me and I continued on and was glad that I did.As mentioned in the book synopsis, Haley had just turned eighteen. She is young and innocent and to me it was as if she lived a pretty sheltered life. This was most likely because she was raised by an overprotective father (who happens to be a single parent) and his closest friend William whom she also calls &#34;daddy&#34;.Daddy William has been in Haley's life since she was a baby and as she progressed into her teenage years he starts developing feelings for her. Rather than acting upon these feelings however, he keeps his desires under wraps and ends up distancing himself.William isn't the only one feeling this attraction. Haley also starts feeling these changes between them. It takes one frightening near miss for William to realize that it was finally their time.What happens after that I would have to say was... mind-blowing yet somewhat unsettling too. I say unsettling because there was certain terminology and situations that made me uneasy.What I did appreciate about this story though was how William went about things. He never wanted to risk the deep rooted friendship that he had with Haley's father and was willing to make these sacrifices when his feelings became too much. If that wasn't an indication of true love then I don't know what else is!There were also these intense &#34;OMG&#34; moments that could have gotten real ugly but William handled all these situations perfectly and I have to say that I admired how the author pulled it off.While this book in general was a bit uncomfortable I thought this was what made it standout and keep me captivated.All in all, I thought it was good and I am hoping that the author decides to expand on this fascinating couple's story.liezelsbookblog.net", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Awkwardly good", "unixReviewTime": 1405987200, "reviewTime": "07 22, 2014"}

Oh my goodness I really loved this book, and if I hadn't had to go to work the next day after I started reading, I would have finished it in one sitting.  Yes, this book was that good!I was very hesitant in picking up this book.  It had been on my radar for awhile.  I had been told by friends that it's either hit or miss.  You either love it, or you hate it.  It depends on your style of reading.  Yes there are flashbacks.  Yes it's told from two characters points of views.  But I didn't find this confusing at all because the book is so short.  It's under 250 pages, so honestly I had no issues with keeping track of the shifting point of views and timelines.  I really felt like I was reading two stories in one.  And both stories kept me intrigued, and I loved both main characters.Mind Games tells the story of two sisters, Sofia (Fia) and Annie.  Both sisters have paranormal abilities.  Fia has an uncanny ability of having perfect instincts.  She's the type of person that could predict lottery numbers.  Annie is blind, but occasionally she has flashes that allows her to see into the future.  These sisters are tight.  They are very close.  And I don't know if it's because I have recently seen the movie Frozen, but it's so nice to read a book with a close sibling bond.  The young adult market is flooded with romance.  It's a nice change of a pace to see someone risking it all for a sibling.  Not that there isn't romance, because there is.  But the main story line involves the bond between two sisters.This is a story that needs to be told first person.  Seeing inside Fia and Annie's mind is just sheer brilliance.  Amazing.  The story flows so nicely.  I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if it was told from third person.  I needed to feel Fia's pain and suffering.  I needed to feel Annie's frustrations and fears.  Also I found both girls to be extremely likable.  I embraced Fia's snark.  I didn't find it annoying or unnecessary.  And Annie's guilt about not being able to protect her sister, even though she is older than she is really translated well to paper.I cannot wait to read the sequel Perfect Lies!

But like I said, not a happy ending.It needs another run through with an editor, but that&#8217;s my only MINOR complaint. Like I said, the ending. Major complaint there.I don&#8217;t think I could ever come to terms with this. I just&#8230; I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll stop ranting, because I want you to go check out this series.

Hillenbrand, however, has taken this chapter of our history to a new level. While I was prepared for brutality and cruelty, I wasn't prepared to the psychological damage done by the captors to the captives. I also wasn't prepared for the struggle these men went through after they came back to the United States to pickup their shattered lives. Although many stories end with liberation from the POW camp, Hillenbrand continues to follow the story to chronicle Louis Zamperini and others as they attempted to integrate into American society.Beware to all readers, this is a difficult book to read. I found myself rushing through the POW years because I couldn't stand to dwell on the torture and inhumanity exhibited by a large number of Japanese officers. My heart ached to see how Louis and others were haunted by their experiences long after the war ended.Reading the notes at the end of each chapter and acknowledgments at the end of the book gave me a glimpse into the amount of work Hillenbrand  did to document this book. I also understand she encountered some medical problems during the writing of this book. I'm thankful for the sacrifices she made in chronicling the sacrifices of so many brave souls.Who are these brave souls? Japan held some 132,000 POWs from America, Britian, Canada, New Zealand, Holland and Australia. Of those, nearly 36,000 died, more than one in every four. This does not include as many as 100,000 Asians who died as laborers especially Chinese.To all of these souls, this book is a memorial to their sacrifices.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Lest We Forget", "unixReviewTime": 1393718400, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2014"}

A few days ago, I read Falling For My Husband by Pamela Ann. I loved the characters, the angst, the dirty talk and steamy scene, etc...

I'm freaking out here, and I can't believe I have to wait to find out what will happen with Grey and Liv. I was at work last night, and I couldn't wait to get home and continue this story. Rarely does a book keep me up until I have to make myself put it down, because my eyes are blurring. As soon as I woke up this morning, I picked up right where I left off and couldn't stop until it was finished.Needless to say, I have found my new favorite author!Pieces Of You & Me is downright stressful, but addicting. Greyson is the ultimate angsty-alpha, with an incredibly sweet side that he only shows to Liv. He's a playboy and an adrenaline junkie, but he's mush for Liv. Liv, on the other hand, is extremely frustrating. She is the stress; Grey is the addiction. At first, I kind of admired her sassiness and strong will, but then she just made me so mad. I couldn't stand to see Grey hurt so much over her. Stupid girl. I hate her so much, but she drives the story. Her actions initiated Grey to change and show us the wonderful qualities he had underneath the rough edges. So, if her being a stupid girl makes Grey take his shirt off... I'm okay with that.Let me have a total book nerd moment...I want Grey to be real, and I want him to be my boyfriend!Okay, I'm good now.If you hate stressful cliffys, wait to buy this until the second comes out.

This did not influence my opinion of the book.I really enjoyed Blast of the Dragon's Fury. From the moment I first looked over the map in the front (you know what I'm talking about; every high fantasy novel has one) to the very end of the book, it kept me alternately giggling, facepalming, and struggling not to cheer Andy on out loud.Andy, our main character, is a 10-year-old boy who can't seem to stay out of trouble. He is always getting calls home at school and can't seem to relate to his parents or his too-perfect sister. Both Andy's parents own large companies and never seem to have time for him except to lecture him about what he's doing wrong.Then one day Andy suddenly finds himself mysteriously transported to a mysterious land where he meets a king and his wizard who tell him they think he is destined to break a curse that has plagued their land for over 500 years. The curse takes the form of a fog that blankets the land of Oomaldee, making travel slow and seeing more than a few feet in front of you impossible. I want to take a moment here and say that all of the place names on the map in the front cracked me up. Most of them start with O and are things like Oohhh or Ooggy, which amused me to no end.Andy stays in the castle where the king lives for a few weeks. During his stay he meets Alden, a servant boy who many people seem to dislike because he is not from Oomaldee. Andy makes friends with Alden, along with many of the other castle residents, and learns some important lessons about being honest and a good friend. I really liked how Andy learned and grew as he discovered the true meaning of friendship.During his stay at the castle, Andy receives a riddle from an unknown source which cryptically instructs him that that first item he needs in order to break the curse of the fog is a red dragon scale. So Andy and Alden set out to find a colony of red dragons and get a scale. The rest of the book covers their adventures in trying to locate the dragons and obtain one of their scales. And it is quite the adventure, because there are several people who do not want them to succeed: Imogenia, the ghost who originally cast the fog curse; plus Abbadon, an enemy of Oomaldee who would love nothing more than for Oomaldee to be forever shrouded in fog.Another thing about Blast of the Dragon's Fury that made me laugh was the wizard, Mermin. He has some sort of speech impediment that makes him sound like Elmer Fudd or the bishop in the movie The Princess Bride. You know, &#34;Mawwiage&#34; and &#34;wascawwy wabbits&#34; and all that. His dialogue kept me chuckling.The only negative comment I really have about this book is that I noticed a few minor typos and grammar mistakes, but I notice those in a lot of books, and these were not so bad as to detract from my enjoyment of the story.

And there is no author!  The arrangements are so bad, imho, that I'm willing to bet they were entered into notation/tab software by a guitar player whose ear is trained enough (takes very little ear-training for this) that he/she knows where the melody notes are on guitar, and he keyed that quickly in, put chord strums on the beats where no melody note lies, and that's &#34;the arrangement.&#34;  In other words, this stuff, I'm betting, was never performed.  Any first-year music student could so easily write this with NO guitar anywhere around!This stuff is *not* what a bluegrass picker would EVER stand up and play.  In fact they're SO unlike real guitar music, and so uninteresting, I can't imagine even a rank beginner having real fun with them. There's *so* much other stuff that's GOOD. And has audio examples for more effective learning.Mel Bay's guitar method, for example, teaches early students an arrangement of &#34;Red Haired Boy&#34; that is the real thing - a bluegrass player would actually play that way. There's no such thing in this book.  An oldie but goodie is Happy Traum's book, Bluegrass Guitar.  It's only a bit more money, but it teaches you the real thing - no matter your level.  (He has a DVD that goes great with the book - Amazon sells them together.)Btw, I'm saying this isn't Carter Style, because Mother Maybelle's &#34;style&#34; was to play the lead notes with a thumb pick, while filling in the &#34;spaces&#34; by a &#34;scratch&#34; it's called - &#34;the Carter scratch&#34; - with her forefinger.  A strum of the top two or three treble strings. These &#34;arrangements&#34; are to be played with a plectrum - a flat regular guitar pick.  Also, the Carters didn't play bluegrass!  Most important of all, this stuff doesn't *sound* like Maybelle's playing.  And, these tunes are not &#34;bluegrass guitar classics,&#34; except for Wildwood Flower, the final thing the book presents.

Schultz weaves her story around the small community of Windsor, New York. Readers who enjoy a story with mystery and suspense will be hooked from the time they open the cover of A TAINTED MIND to the end. Tamsen Schultz's story is full of thrills and surprises and a thread of romance. The threads of romance are an integral part of Schultz's story. While driving towards Windsor, New York, Vivienne DeMarco stops to change a flat tire and the excitement begins. She finds the remains of a body in a sinkhole by the road. Later she helps determine there is a serial killer in Windsor, New York.Each character receives additional development when Schultz wants her readers to know more of their backstory. One of the two main characters is Vivienne DeMarco, an accomplished investigator, FBI consultant, and Medical Examiner with many family ties and nationwide law enforcement connections. DeMarco has a tainted past that haunts her. The other main character is Ian MacAllister, Deputy Chief of Police of Windsor P.D., an ex-military special forces who returned home after an injury. Ian went into law enforcement because he did not know what else to do. He has family ties all over the county.Some of the side characters show the broad scope of Vivienne DeMarco contacts. Many of them are her relatives with great investigative skills. Four side characters play important roles in A TAINTED MIND.  Vivienne's two cousins Naomi an Brian are media investigators and a distant cousin Travis is a location scout for movie producers. We have one more character Nick Lavortoy, an army special investigator with a dark history.Schultz does a wonderful job of keeping the suspense and mystery alive from beginning to the end of the story. The weaving of romance among key characters could be dangerous for the characters involved. We watch MacAllister and DeMarco form a team to find the serial killer at large. They are trying to identify the motive of the serial killer and his or her obsession. Their research has found the serial killing murder spree goes back years. Modern research skills are part of the team. This mystery has plenty of action with Schultz illustrating modern technology to find answers and identify suspects quicker. The team hopes to find the killer's motive and obsession in time to stop the increasing body count.Building suspense, tension, and enhancing danger to the main characters is masterfully done by Schultz. We see modern law enforcement work at its best and learn that common sense and gut feelings still help bring killers to justice. We see how caring for one another still is a strong thread to keep relationships work. In A TAINTED MIND the team helps identify suspects using modern technology,but MacAllister and DeMarco still need common sense to make good decisions. Tamsen Schultz has given us a 5 star mystery an ending you will not believe until you read it. It is easy for me to recommend Schultz's A TAINTED MIND and give it a rating 5 star.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Mystery Full of Exciting Characters Delivering Thrills and Suspense To The Story.", "unixReviewTime": 1401062400, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2014"}

I place great value on his comments following various events in our current history, though I don't always find myself in complete agreement with his opinions or conclusions. His integrity, his intelligence, his wisdom and insight are never in question.So it was with eager anticipation that I began to read his novels several years ago. I must say I've learned more about the intricacies of politics in the Middle East from his &#34;fiction&#34; than from dozens of print articles or broadcast media. This book had me almost holding my breath as the plot twisted and turned. It presents a compelling, stunning, and not implausible &#34;shadow CIA&#34; that seems even more believable, given the most recent revelations about our Intelligence community's breadth and depth. His characters reveal not just their strengths, but their weaknesses, their failings, their prejudices - in short, their humanity - as the plots likewise unfold.I say my &#34;favorite&#34; perhaps because I was in need of an engaging book that was well written, a focus that was entirely new to me, and yet one in which I could just relax and &#34;go with the flow&#34; rather than be edified, despite my appreciation for what I've learned from others of his novels.Ignatius probably knows as much about the inner workings of the CIA and other national Intelligence operations as any other person outside McLean, and arguably may have a better grasp of &#34;the big picture&#34; than anyone inside or out.If you want a spy thriller with corpses in various European locales, red herrings amid tantalizing clues, and compelling characters worthy of the plot's twists and turns, then this is a book you'll not want to put down.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "So far, my favorite of his.", "unixReviewTime": 1401667200, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2014"}

Baime (July 2014).  I have read hundreds of books related to World War II, and I initially thought that this book would be a rather boring look at production data regarding various WWII aircraft.  I could not have been more wrong.This is the first WWII book that I have regarding how the Ford Motor Co. -- primarily at the instigation of Edsel Ford -- started from scratch in building warplanes to support Pres. FDR&#8217;s desire of supplying warplanes to the British and Russians.This is the first time that I have read anything about how Henry Ford was so opposed to the &#8220;socialist&#8221; polices of FDR, that Henry actively strove to curtail -- if not outright end -- his company&#8217;s efforts in supplying warplanes to the British.  Besides Henry&#8217;s almost fanatical opposition to anything FDR was advocating, Henry was a pacifist who thought that his company&#8217;s production of warplanes would assist FDR in guiding the U.S. into war in support of Britain.Henry apparently had a sincere loathing of war, and its destructive consumption of soldiers and civilians &#8211; so much so that Henry became an active pacifist in opposing America&#8217;s slip-sliding into war in support of England.Unlike Henry, his son Edsel was all aboard in supporting FDR&#8217;s plans in aiding the UK. Having not been familiar with this topic before, I found this book to be very informative with its revelations about how harsh the split was between Henry and Edsel, as to how the Ford Motor Co. might enter the production of warplanes.  The company had never before manufactured airplanes.Henry hired the famous aviator Charles Lindbergh for advice in how to manufacture warplanes, and as they both thought that the Allies could not defeat Hitler&#8217;s well-armed Nazi Germany, both were against the U.S. in aiding the UK &#8211; in fear that the U.S. would be dragged into the war. Prior to reading this book, I had no inkling of how Henry distrusted his own son, Edsel, in running the company &#8211; so much so that he even hired Henry Bennett to be his hatchet-man in running the company, instead of his son Edsel.  Henry also used Bennett in various shocking violent union-busting activities.Even before starting the production of warplanes, Henry&#8217;s dominance of the auto industry was falling as he failed to head buyers&#8217; opinions that they wanted more variety in their automobiles.  Edsel wanted to head these changing trends, but Henry -- perhaps due to medical problems &#8211; failed to follow buyers&#8217; desires.The book briefly discusses some of the racial conflicts/riots that broke out, as southern blacks moved to Detroit and were hired to fill the many manufacturing jobs in Detroit.  I would have liked to have seen the author expand on this topic.As I read through this book, I initially thought that I would give it just 3-stars, and as I learned more, 4 stars -- until finally realizing how encompassing this book really is, I finally raised it to a 5-star rating.The author wrote about the difficulties of how the Ford company was curtailed in its warplane manufacturing due to the lack of availability of raw materials, as well as the difficulty in building a warplane-manufacturing complex in a rush while American military forces were suffering defeats in early 1942.Even without this book&#8217;s look at Ford&#8217;s entering the warplane-production business, this book could have stood on its own with its remarkable insight into the dysfunctional business thoughts between Henry and his son Edsel.  What was never resolved was why Henry was so opposed to auto innovation in his company.It was interesting to learn how Edsel's wife broke the logjam in enticing Henry to turn the control of his company over to his grandson Henry II.I highly recommend this book to any student of World War II &#8211; it must not be overlooked for understanding in part how the American manufacturing industry came to provide the armaments needed to defeat the Axis.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pacifists don't make good warplane builders.", "unixReviewTime": 1402358400, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2014"}

This allows him to spend most of the book telling his story, and he does that well.Once again, Mr. Nuttall has written a fiction book that seems to be based in reality.  I find it easy to imagine how the world could have evolved in the manner he describes.  He goes into enough detail to interest me, without ever boring me.

Hero is substantial, unique, and dripping with ORIGINALITY. It's about good and bad, and the blurred lines between them. Not everything is black and white. Love can be good or bad and sometimes it lies somewhere in between.I absolutely loved Every. Single. Minute. Of. This. Book. Hero is unlike anything I have ever read! I ended up beta reading Hero by sheer dumb luck, and it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. I was always hesitant to beta read in the past because you read a story more than once and the excitement of reading something for the first time is lost forever. I read Hero more than once, and I can honestly say each time was like reading it for the first time all over again.It's difficult to tell you what the story is without giving it all away. For me, a book is all about not knowing what to expect going in and hopefully getting the surprise I was anticipating. I can definitely say Hero gave me the surprise I was craving and much more. So, I'm not going to say much about the storyline. Hero is too unique and saying too much will surely ruin the experience for you. So let me say what it's NOT:1. it's not a traditional romance,2. it's not a love story,3. it's not about a boy meeting a girl and riding off into the sunset together4. it's not on black end of the \"dark\" spectrum, and5. it's not \"different\"; different is an unfair categorization because defining different is subjective. I will say it again: Hero is ORIGINAL and UNIQUE.The writing is mature and eloquent and it immensely adds to the flow of the story. Leighton Del Mia has crafted a story with depth and intelligence. It's much more than a story being told on the surface.Hero was a page turner for me. I was utterly captivated and could not put it down. With the intricate and twisty storyline, Leigton Del Mia kept me on my toes and on the edge of my seat wanting to know what happens next. The characters are definitely likeable. The heroine is strong and intelligent. The hero is tortured, haunted, and slightly evil but Leighton Del Mia found a way to make me like him anyway!Personally, I like where the story ended. I'm not a huge believer in the epilogue. Yes, it's nice to have but not all stories need them. Sometimes, things are better left unsaid. For those that need closure, there will be a novella available on release day. I enjoyed the novella just as much as I did Hero.For me, Hero is a 5 star read .

Books about escorts don&#8217;t always work for me but this one did; I truly enjoyed Rock and Carter&#8217;s journey to happy!The first meeting between Rock and Carter instantly pulled me into this story. It is clear that Rock is not comfortable in his own skin and Carter&#8217;s desire to help with that kept me wanting more.  My heart broke for Rock and his inability to accept himself.I truly loved the author&#8217;s portrayal of Rock&#8217;s struggle early on in the book and I adored how Ms. Aicher emphasized to the reader how this developing relationship was different for Carter (and I love the very quick departure from client to dating).As things developed, I really did love Carter making it clear that this was different for him, as I said I don&#8217;t always love escort books and I think this piece was so critical.  When the reader is dealing with a character who has sex for money, I feel it is imperative that the author show how this relationship and then how this physical contact is deeper.  Ms. Aicher did that in spades, Carter says it, Carter shows it, sometimes Carter even regresses as he feels unworthy of Rock.  And the author also emphasizes this with the use of a secondary character Tyler, a former escort as well, who is a friend to both Rock and Carter. Tyler truly added to this story.Carter questioning himself was so well done, watching what at first appears to be a confident man, to one questioning himself, to one questioning his place in the world, to one questioning the connection he is building with Rock all felt so true to the character, and had me wanting Carter to embrace the happy before him.As a reader, I think it is easy to see that at some point Carter&#8217;s &#8220;profession&#8221; will affect the deepening and growing relationship these two men have; I have to say I loved how this was handled, it felt true to the men, and was truly powerful.The use of Carter&#8217;s &#8220;hobby&#8221; for the book's resolution and Rock&#8217;s acceptance of himself was beautiful! The reader is painted some mental images of Rock that are haunting and the use of them is something I hope bleeds into real life one day (it makes sense when you read the book).  And it made for an end that left me smiling from ear to ear.

The book is a blend of dark and urban fantasy that was well written and captivating. The characters were original and the mix of supernaturals was wonderful. I also love urban fantasies because they aren't afraid to throw in the whole melting pot of supers and this one didn't disappoint. The story flowed perfectly and kept me from wanting to put it down. The plot was the right mix of action, fantasy, darkness and the subtle romance in the right places. I had no problems envisioning the world as the details were well done and spot on. The tension in the plot was wonderfully mastered  right up until the end....darn end (spoiler). The strongest element in this book was the story itself - the details were thought out and the storyline masterfully executed. I can't wait to see what we come up against in the next installment.Characters: Natalya- Natalya is a fun heroine and perfectly fit for her job and the world she's in. She's a touch on the cliche side as this character (the type not Natalya) has become very popular. However that doesn't stop her from being well written. She's sassy, sarcastic and kick butt. She's been looking out for herself and does it properly but she has no issues falling in line with her partner or protecting others. I also enjoyed that she was a tiger shifter as it gave her a little something extra.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great book 1", "unixReviewTime": 1399593600, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2014"}

I love the way he brings the reader right into the country and the hearts of the characters. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for this stand-alone novel. There is a basic rule for good writing: show, don't tell. He breaks this rule right from the start. It's a bit like listening to your grandfather tell you about a place he's been. He makes it sound interesting, but he's still lecturing you. You don't mind too much, because he's your grandfather, but it's still not what you'd prefer. Similarly, the author doesn't build his characters by showing you what they do or having an assortment of detailed scenes. Instead, he outlines David and Amanda, gives them one major scene with conversation, and then moves on. I would rather have had a few more pages (or many more) in which we see the growth of both people. As it is, one hardly knows why they got married; there's no sense of true connection. The Forever Girl is their daughter, who chooses to rename herself Clover. Clover has a childhood friendship and she decides at some point that she's in love with her playpal, James. Despite years of separation, few visits and little communication, she continues to believe herself in love with him. It sounds more like arrested development than the real thing.

I was pleasantly surprised by the lightness of the story line &#8211; even if the Devil and Demon Chicks were involved. The story  had actual laugh out loud and feel good moments. The book was reminiscent to me of several TV shows that were geared to tweens and could be found on Disney or Nick at Night. Shows like Wizards of Waverly Place, Sabrina the Teenage Witch and the Zenon movies amongst others.The characters were well developed and I could feel their angst and worries over normal high school issues even if they were in the demon world. The descriptions were vivid and I felt I was there &#8211; smelling the honey and makeup flavors, flying around when in demon mode, and seeing the locations where the story took place &#8211; Washington D.C., the high school and Morgan&#8217;s apartment. There were the normal teenage moments of rebellion, friendships and family along with lots of girlie things whether in the real or demon world. I liked the way the author showed us the demon world through some of the specific classes that were offered and &#8220;potty mouth&#8221; words that were used.There was nice closure to the story although very unexpected. The book took many twists and turns but kept my interest throughout. I would give another book by Lyle a try and may grow to like both young adult books and paranormals that have a lighter bent.Favorite Quote:  If my throat hadn&#8217;t been so desert dry, I would have gulped.

She wrote this book for 3 reasons:  1.  She needs money.  She will make money from this book; good for her.  She knows how to make the most of an opportunity.  2.  She is a woman scorned and wants revenge.  She attempts to get back at Ben for not really loving her or paying much attention to her after the show, by writing this book and trashing him throughout.  She might feel better after airing her dirty laundry about Ben and her relationship with him (or lack thereof),and if it made her feel better, then good for her (even though to the readers, she comes across as pathetic and immature).  3.  She wants to repair her image from the Bachelor.  The book gives additional insight into Courtney's psyche, but it is not pretty, and does little to repair her image.I watch the Bachelor because it is silly and funny, and so NOT real.  Anyone who thinks it is real or that it is possible to find deep, meaningful love after dating one person for a few hours over several weeks, while that person is also dating 24 other people, is extremely misguided.  Courtney Robertson seems to fall into the misguided category.  She seems to believe that she instantly fell madly in love with Ben, whom she actually loved after watching him on TV as a Bachelorette contestant.  Plus, she actually believes that he fell instantly in love with her, too.  After being sure of the deep and instant love connection, Courtney unravels as Ben plays out his stint on the Bachelor, and after the show, does not seem interested in Courtney.  She does not seem to understand why Ben reverts to being a frat boy, who becomes a womanizer after achieving fame from being the Bachelor.  She does not understand why he will not ask her to move in with him, and would prefer living with his frat boy buddies.  Throughout the book, Courtney recounts all the immature behavior of Ben and how his personality is boring and uncaring, yet despite her recognizing it, she seems to overlook it and throws herself at him in order to get him to change.  I found Courtney's endless complaining about Ben to be confused and confusing.  I was hoping there would be a lot more to this book, but most of it was complaining about Ben.  When she finally moved on to Arie, I was so glad to be done reading about Ben, but the Arie parts were brief and then she went right back to complaining about Ben.  What a waste of reading time!The book was not worth the $11.99 that I paid.  The only interesting parts were about the Bachelor process of auditioning (a few pages worth), and a little bit about behind the scenes and Bachelor Nation.  I would have liked to have had more of that in the book.The other negative aspect of this book was Courtney constantly putting down so many other people, in addition to Ben.  Courtney is so insecure and narcissistic that she puts down others to make herself feel superior.  Courtney used writing this book as catharsis, but I hope that she gets the professional help that she needs.  She relies on her looks for everything in her life, and she lives a superficial existence.  She is going to be even more depressed than she already is, when she gets too old to model, loses her looks, and has to rely upon something other than looks to get work and a relationship.The book reads like the diary of a high school girl with a crush.  It is poorly written, although there is an occasional \"big\" word thrown in to make it seem like the writer has intelligence.  There is no plot or direction.  There is no resolution.  The book is organized as follows:  Courtney has bad relationships before the show, auditions, goes on show, hates her time on show, hates the women, loves Ben, cannot get Ben to pay attention to her, breaks up with Ben.  The end.I only recommend this book to Bachelor fans who have enormous curiosity to learn a little more about the show, and a lot more about Courtney and Ben, most of which are Courtney's negative perceptions.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Bachelor fans get insight, but most of the book is a waste of time and money.", "unixReviewTime": 1404432000, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2014"}

FAR FROM IT ,in fact it is the first time i have read a book where i could not remember the title nor what i read every time i put it down.The female is the worst person you will probably ever read about ,apart from the fact that she is a GIANT contradiction, she supposedly is a 26 year old virgin who has fend off unwanted attentions from lords and turned down proposals of marriage yet she is all over the hero as if she is a practised courtesan , she rambles on and on and on how the hero's intended is a great girl yet has no qualms messing about with another girls man, her excuse they are not yet official ,really ? She then stands up for the girl but calls her a simpleton to the hero ,and gets cross at the girl for showing a lively nature finally .Lala (the intended) is so much sweeter and kinder than the heroine very reminiscint of Lady Diana and Camilla , the heroine being the latter ofcourse.The author was going for a comparison where the heroine was supposed to be vivacious intelligent lively compared to the shy timid simple girl the intended was supposed to be ,BUT what she got was a nasty piece of work ,loud mouth ,know it all , floozy,vapid kind of like the girls all guys want to f:::;; but can't stand them the next day they open their mouth , though Lala was attractive too she was not loose much more of a women than the sleeze of a heroine, who cared for no one but herself,another contradiction as she blamed her parents for that I guess the apple fell under the tree ,while Lala was caring and really very considerate and sweet. It seemed the hero was really thinking with his .... When picking between the two! Lala would have definitely made him a better wife whereas the heroine could definitely sleep with his best mate in the long run ! At times she pretends decorum the next it is out the window , she decorates to impress the upperclass yet has no qualms to participate in a discussion of willies in front of supposed ladies .The scene where she a marquesse's daughter and a duke and another lord were chatting and laughing and had made Lala feel left out was so nasty again it reminded me of Camilla making fun of Diana when the latter knew she was with her husband ,I thought the Hero was a bastard , how is it he fit in and Lady Lala did not????which he bandied about every chance he could ,not that it was taboo then in that era???also he keeps saying he was bought up in the streets when the duke had taken him just a toddler.My final disappointment was how conveniently Lala's story played out ,by far the imagination in this story was lacking! The romance and sensuality ,leading up to romance scenes ,were by far non existent and the sex scenes a giant perfunctory yawn where the next day everyone carries on as if nothing happened . It was so boring i never had time to return it ,what a waste of money ,all i can say is if this is one of the 5 one reviewer would keep i can't imagine what her portrayal of sensual sexy romance is? Also this awful female claims a child her own an ruins herself then lies on a bed with hero's best friend for the night and he has claimed her as a wife , which of these two would ever happen in that era ? The fat ridiculous book of contradictions does not stop there , the hero sob story of how he was forced to dive into the muddy Thames to retrieve items of value and how he would kill his abuser for risking his life and that of other boys come to another eye rolling ridiculous result , when the hero begs and pays his friends to do exactly that again to retrieve a pouch lost over 10 years ago in muddy Thames for this stupid female!?

She uses this ability to quietly question exhibitors about the body she found murdered in a dumpster.Although the police are focused on the dead man's wife as their prime suspect, Heather thinks she's innocent and decides to do some amateur detecting. New to the trade floor security team is ex-cop Scott Brandon. Soon he and Heather are working together to solve the crime. They are also exploring the possibility of a romantic relationship.There is a good deal of authentic detail about what it's like to manage a big trade show. I particularly enjoyed the rogue popcorn machine!The characters are sympathetic, the plot is well-developed, and the narrative builds to a tense and exciting conclusion. I did wonder why the police homicide detectives were so ineffective, but this is a perennial problem with amateur detective stories.I enjoyed this novel and would highly recommend it to cozy mystery fans...or to anyone who likes a well-told story.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very Entertaining Cozy Mystery", "unixReviewTime": 1396310400, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2014"}

Back in the 1800&#8242;s medications such as we have today did not exist. This novel weaves fact with fiction and takes us back to when tuberculosis was a deadly disease and many lives were lost.At the beginning of this novel TB is starting to make its presence known in many smaller towns. We meet Christine who loses two children to the disease and when a third comes down with it she vows not to lose her but realizes quickly she&#8217;s fighting a losing battle. That is until her husband tells her of a place called Saranac Lake in the Adirondack Mountains that is referred to as a sanitarium and takes on the sick and cares for them. Being a family of means he is able to secure a spot for his daughter Collette and Christine goes along to be of service any way she can.Arriving there Christine realizes that there are many that need help and not just those in the sanitarium. She also sees though that the work that Dr. Trudeau is doing with these TB patients is making a difference and some actually go on to live a normal life. It is believed the clean mountain air and rest is what helps these patients recover. The patients spend the majority of their days sitting out on the porch in lounge chairs that are dubbed the cure chairs. The most remarkable thing about being at this sanitarium is that the town does not shun TB patients which is in great contrast to how they are treated elsewhere.This novel was fascinating. Of course I know of TB but to hear the history behind what Dr. Trudeau did for so many is remarkable. It was also interesting to learn more about the disease and very interesting to see how doctors tried to treat diseases like this in the past. I can&#8217;t imagine how hard it was for families to watch their loved ones die one after the other because there was no way to help them. Entire families were wiped out. We are very fortunate today to have the medications that we do that save so many lives.I think anyone interested in history and especially the history of TB and the development of the first sanitariums should enjoy this novel. I&#8217;ve read one other of Julie&#8217;s books and I find her writing to be very frank and real.

The supporting characters in this story all seemed more interesting than the main characters at times. Although they weren't central to the plot the little insight into their personalities made me want more.But, seriously time for a review! The story follows two best friends (Julie and Tommy) who have known each other since childhood. They have a pretty balanced friendship on the surface, however as the pages turn we get to find out that one of the characters suffers from an extreme case of unrequited love. Having a crush is putting it mildly when those feelings have lingered there for years. Everyone around them seems to notice the one sided affection, but they still manage to be just friends. I know it sounds like its been done before, but overall the book was pretty good.Abby Niles is a great writer and she did a good job making a cliched plot into a interesting read. Julie's character was very likable. She evolved throughout the book growing from a person who was more concerned with playing it safe and turning into a risk taker. I enjoyed Tommy's character as well and although it was somewhat frustrating that he could be so hot and cold it did spice things up for some very funny and shocking moments within the story.I wasn't bored reading this book (its a pretty quick read), but I hope that the books to come in the series get better and better.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good quick read", "unixReviewTime": 1402790400, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2014"}

Based on the plot and writing of this one, I would be willing to check out the first book from the library. I can't say I was head over heels in love to want to buy it.Jaycee missed the last text of her best friend Rachel's life, caught up in her first kiss and lingering anger from a fight between the girls six months previously. This haunts her as she starts to believe there was more to Rachel's death than is being shared and confirmed when she receives unlikely aid from a friend of Rachel's, sending her down a path of gangs, hazing initiations, jealousy, and racial tensions in a small insular Washington town.For me, this book's big strength was its fast-paced. I read it all in one frantic day, barely able to put it down as each chapter only impelled me to read further. I credit this to the writing and plotting of Wolf-she really kept me on the edge of my seat.Also of interest was peeling back the layers of racism and mistrust between the old timers of the small town and the migrant workers, some of whom may be there illegally. When Rachel is murdered, it is all too easy to lay the blame at the feet of someone who allegedly has ties to a gang or whose skin is a different color from yours. I'm not sure this was handled as thoroughly as it could have been but it might be enlightening for some people and it helped to ratchet up the tension in the beginning of the book.But its weakness for me was its timid and naive narrator, though as the book progresses the reader gets a sense of her strong moral fortitude. I guess you could compare her to Fanny Price of Mansfield Park. She lives within her father's stringent rules and doesn't try to push the bounds of what it means to be a good girl, accepting her fate as one of the uncool. But her best friend considers her the best person she knows, someone who knows right from wrong and will diligently work to expose the truth and render justice (not vengeance, a key distinction). Saying that, even as I admire those kinds of people, they don't tend to be my favorite book characters. I like a bit more flamboyance and wit a la Elizabeth Bennet. The naivety is especially frustrating when it came to the culprit; I started having my suspicions probably later than others but it was eons before Jaycee with her trusting heart.Overall: I am eager to hear the opinion of people who have read Wolf's previous outing as well as those who are well-versed in YA mystery/thrillers.

Dean feels the need to protect Olivia too much to include her in handling the difficulties of life and Olivia is starting to resent it.  Their marriage was once idyllic and is now strained.  Dean withheld the truth of a previous marriage, made Olivia feel isolated in her desire for children and did not let her grow.

Dean&#8217;s father has a heart attack and Dean needs to go to California to be with his family but wants to leave Olivia at home because his family is so mean to her.  He is trying to protect her again, but Olivia will have none of it and convinces him to take her.  He is called back to interview for the sexual accusations and tells his ex-wife Helen about it, but not Olivia.  Of course that is going to come back to bite him.

The author's personable presentation is an interdisciplinary magnum opus of big-history theorizing rooted in essential bean-counting analysis, running from the beginning of observable space-and-time over 13 billion years ago to our present-day global village, and even boldly projecting our (accelerating) development out into the foreseeable future (year 2103).  No work better bridges the gap between the humanities and the sciences--the book should be required summer reading for all freshmen entering college.Surely, Morris is a unifier.  By analogy, he is archeology and history's Newton (classical mechanics) or, better yet, a Maxwell (classical electromagnetism), but not yet an Einstein (seeker of a complete unified field theory).  Similar to Maxwell, who taught us that light is a combination of electric and magnetic phenomena, Morris provides a way of viewing humanity across the West-East divide.  However, extending beyond Eurasia-centric West and East, a more comprehensive theory would need to include at least South and Southeast Asia (with India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Philippines), South and Central America (with Brazil and Mexico), and Africa (which by 2100 is projected to have 11 of the top 20 countries by population, including Nigeria, Tanzania, DR Congo, Ethiopia and Uganda in the top 10).  In a sense, Morris's focus on Eurasia is an example of what he elsewhere calls \"chainsaw art,\" making crude cuts to exhibit gross features, while ignoring finer detailing.  Because in science a single exception is sufficient to invalidate a theory, the greater diversity of our world requires a broader scope encompassing the developmental history of all geographical regions, not just Eurasia.Perhaps a more inclusive theory would shed light on the likelihood of some other region of our world rising to global leadership as we muddle along, \"rarely knowing what we are doing,\" as Morris says.  If it is true that \"people--in large groups--are all much the same,\" what is to prevent a crowded India, resource-rich Brazil, or quickly expanding Nigeria from one day leading the pack?  After all, they too must be as \"lazy, greedy and frightened\" as Eurasians, also \"looking for easier, more profitable, and safer ways to do things,\" right?  As technology becomes more available and affordable (ever ponder what happens when 3D-printing extends to food?), more rapid oscillations in development and shifts in world leadership could conceivably lie ahead.Maybe a Singularity (or Nightfall) really is the most probable outcome, but from my humble perspective, claiming that cultural distinctions will be erased through a Singularity appears to be the \"lazy\" way out of a messy, multi-continental analysis--one that, if done properly, should embrace all of the greater complexity inherent in the colorful history and cultural diversity of humankind.In Morris's recounting, both \"Albert in 1848 Beijing\" and \"Zheng in 1431 Tenochtitlan,\" of course, were only fictional.  How about \"Morris in the 2040 Singularity\"?  Ian Morris was born in Stoke-on-Kent (also called Potteries--think \"Wedgwood\"), England, in 1960, and as a teenager in 1970s Britain \"sat around wearing American jeans, watching American films, and playing American guitars.\"  In the early 2000s, when Professor Morris was busy at Stanford researching and writing Why the West Rules--For Now, \"the China price\" became \"the three scariest words in U.S. industry,\" as made-in-China anything and everything hollowed out American manufacturing.  By the time the 2040s come around, will Chimerica prove to be reality or chimera?  By 2050, I hope to read Professor Emeritus Morris's sequel, Why the West-East Divide No Longer Matters--For the Singularity is Here!  Or, might it be, Why the East Now Rules--For the Singularity Will be Late in Arriving?  Or, maybe even, Why Africa Rules--A Fortuitous 60,000 year Homecoming?[This book review is an abridged version of more complete commentary available at lloydsinvestment.blogspot.com.]", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Towards a More Inclusive Theory", "unixReviewTime": 1391904000, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2014"}

Hermes' body is consuming itself, Athena is growing feathers internally, and the other gods are in equal decline. Even the Greek heroes of old have been reborn, but they have no memories of their past lives or knowledge of their identities. As a mythology nerd and a huge fan of Anna Dressed in Blood, I was immediately drawn to the novel.The concept of Antigoddess was intriguing, but it was the execution of it is what made it shine. Every time Athena pulled a feather through the skin in her mouth or Hermes was even described, I would cringe. Blake was able to open my imagination, and I could almost feel the feathers and emaciation. The pacing did drag some through the middle, but the ending was glorious. Blake does not hesitate in killing her characters off most gruesomely, and that is exciting in itself. There was also the mirroring of the events regarding the Trojan War that rocked my socks.Antigoddess' characters were just as interesting as the concept. Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom and warfare, had not been worshipped in years and looked very like the typical teenage girl, right down to the purple streaks in her hair. She knew that she was dying, but was not willing to die - or even allow her brothers to, for that matter - without a fight. Watching her step minisculely away from her hardened virginal stance to open her heart was sweet to watch. Hermes was a good balance to his sister Athena's hardened nature and was much more human. Cassandra and Aiden were an abnormally well adjusted couple who were happily in love on the other side of the country. He was fully aware of her psychic abilities and supportive of them, though he was a bit boring. When these characters were brought together, it did not seem forced, and the story-lines melted together nicely.However, despite all of these great things about Antigoddess, I never really got into it. I did not realize this until the end. The scenes at the end were well-written and exciting, but I found myself not caring about the outcome overmuch. I have been crying at the drop of a hat while reading lately, and I did not get emotional at all during the last battle in the book. This was surprising to me because I was one hundred percent into Anna Dressed in Blood.Even though I was not caught up in the events and characters of Antigoddess, it was still an enjoyable read. I think fans of Blake's previous work and Greek mythology in general will eat up this novel.

But the way of life, the hopes of his family and friends are foreign to him.  Both he and Earth are rushing into the immediate future where those he loves and the entire population will be shattered by forces so deceptive they appear to be friends.  When his girlfriend is exposed to crushing danger, Jack is compelled to take extreme measures that reveal who he is and what he must do.  In the face of impossible odds, this young man must accept the challenge and fight for immortality-or die in obscurity. (taken from the back of the book)Every one in awhile a book comes along that's incredibly difficult to review.  This is just such a book.  There's so much depth to discover that it can't possibly be covered in a few short paragraphs.  It's like looking at an origami version of the Taj Mahal.  You can get an idea of what it is, but there's just no way to convey the magnificence.  Bear with me and I'll do my best.This is not light reading.  It took me over 3 days and the only reason I was able to finish within that time was a nasty little flu bug, rendering me incapable of doing much besides reading.  Set aside a week minimum for this one.  It's worth every second of reading time, but you definitely don't want to rush it.The description above doesn't even come close to describing the book.  I really don't want to put much more of a description on here though, because I don't think I can do it without adding some spoilers.  I can tell you this much, the media finally gets what is coming to them, and it's hilariously wrong!Earth and it's inhabitants are portrayed accurately.  The main characters that we have are just astounding.  Not only are they multi-dimensional, but you carry them with you through the book.  There are a lot of them, but it's not difficult at all to keep them straight.  Each one will capture a piece of you, whether it be your heart, your mind, or your emotion.  It's impossible to sit back and read this book without being moved in some way.For  me, the highlight of this book was in the complete unexpectedness.  I read the first few pages and was expecting technical starship science fiction.  You know the type, where Scion 4 has to fix his flux capacitor in order to maintain the galactic emissions control, or some such rot.  This ending up being nothing like that, however.  The book actually takes place on Earth and starts out at a baseball game.  The rest of the book, well, most of it, takes place on Earth.  It's definitely science fiction and otherworldly, but it's also on our home planet, so despite all of the horrors that we witness there's still a bit of a safety net and comfort backdrop.  Not only that, Arthur has taken one of the greatest gifts of a writer and used it to his advantage; there is no limit. Anything can happen.  If you can imagine it, it can exist in your book.  Most of the happenings in the book, and the technology, are beyond the imagination of most people.  It's even beyond the imaginings of most of the characters in the book, but Arthur will make you believe in it.This is not a fast-paced read, but it's definitely riveting.  I can honestly say it's one of the most engrossing books I've read recently.  If you're a hardcore sci-fi reader, this is a must have for your shelf.

I found reading Darshan an emotionally draining experience that pretty well wore me out physically and mentally.  Yes, the book may be a bit too long, something that a skilled and aggressive editor could easily fix, but undue length explains little or nothing of the book's effect.  Instead, the omnipresence of both inter-generational and intra-generational conflict, coupled with the demands of coping with life in colonial Indian Sikh society and its eventual dissolution are presented in a way that makes emphatically clear that everyday existence is extremely taxing.Across three generations and two vast continents, the primary circumstances of the characters in Darshan are struggle, disappointment, and an inability to be mutually supportive of members of the same extended family.  Though participating in a culture sharply different from our own, Darshan, even at its most long-suffering, enables the reader to empathize with its characters in a way that makes their hard and stressful circumstances almost impossible not to absorb.  Their struggles and disappointments become the reader's struggles and disappointments to a degree that is quite uncommon in my experience with contemporary fiction.This applies, moreover, not only to the three successive main characters, Baba Sing, Manmohan, and Darshan, but to members of their extended family and ancillary but interesting characters such as the mechanic, Junker Singh.  Junker Singh provides an unexpectedly light-hearted and rustically humorous counterpoint to the sometimes suffocating seriousness and determination of so many other Sikhs.  Nevertheless, Junker Singh understands the others, offering keen insights and unsolicited but friendly and sympathetic advice that he hopes will ease his friends' burdens.  The source of Junker Singh's singularly buoyant approach to life and its demands and frustrations is not explained, but it is interesting that the same culture and the same society could yield someone who knew the others so well but lived so differently.By contrast, the three main characters, grandfather, father, and son, were not only personally dissimilar, but they understood each other very poorly if at all.  It's true that Baba Sing suffered the disadvantage of being away from his family for a decade, serving with the colonial Sikh constabulary in Hong Kong, with only epistolary contact with his wife and children.  Nevertheless, when he finally returned home, he was cold, remote, and authoritarian, at times seemingly uninterested in his sons and daughters, including Manmohan.To Manmohan and his siblings, his father was an accomplished, even glamorous, master of traditional Sikh military arts, who had experienced the world beyond their small Indian village.  Baba Sing, however, was not inclined to use their admiration as a basis for establishing warm paternal relationships.  His first concern was to demonstrate to them that the world is a hard place where sentiment and unsubstantiated praise are detrimental to survival.  Given the novel's beginning, however, these were lessons that Baba Sing might have assumed his children had already learned.After the family and many other Sikhs migrated to the Fiji Islands, Manmohan and his wife, Jai, had children of their own, including their oldest son Mohan, along with Darshan and his sisters.  Darshan was well-behaved and did well in school, and the others were equally tractable, except Mohan.  Mohan gave no evidence of academic ability.  Frustrated, Manmohan could not accept Mohan's limitations, and he inadvertently set them both up for disappointment, perhaps even a sense of betrayal.Similarly, as the members of the extended family grew older and became securely established in Fiji, Baba Sing used his paternal authority in ways that diminished the value of Manmohan's hard work and attainments, inflicting perhaps even more material and familial damage that that which had characterized the relationship between Manmohan and Mohan.  From one generation to another a pattern of expectations, effort, failure, disloyalty, and loss seemed to be emerging.The bitter disappointment, rage, and fatalistic determinism felt by the characters are impossible for the reader to ignore.  When Darshan migrates to the U.S., all but a few of the rest of the family eventually follow.  They bring with them, in exaggerated form, the same lack of trust and inexplicable ignorance of those who are closest to them.  Whatever their attainments, their lives are predictably hate-filled, miserable, and fraught with jealousy.  Even Darshan's children, born to him and his American wife, are much less satisfied and otherwise quite different from what one might have expected.Chima's novel begins with suffering and loss due to the criminality of officials operating under the auspices of an oppressive colonial regime.  Though circumstances change dramatically over the course of the next century, happiness proves to be hopelessly elusive.  One might try to explain this through reference to a harsh and insular paternalistic society and the equally difficult transition to modernity, but my efforts in this regard were fruitless.  Furthermore, the novel's boiler plate explanation for cross-generational dissatisfaction is oddly mystical and simply does not seem plausible.  In this respect, then, readers are left to fend for themselves.Darshan is not an uplifting novel, but the author has a remarkable talent for describing the physical environment, especially the beauty that pervades the lush, green Punjab area of India.  During reprieves from discord, when the interior lives of characters are translated into material manifestations of beauty and fertility that bespeak occasions of happiness and feelings of freedom, the novel is truly marvelous.  It elicits reactions that are best described as joyously visceral.  Still, Chima's prose that gets under the reader's skin and stays there bespeaks spiritual impoverishment rather than live-giving sustenance.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Generations of Loss", "unixReviewTime": 1390953600, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2014"}

First, it seems a natural follow up to the 60s bookThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions: 50th Anniversary Editionwhich Harry Collins refers to - along with a chain of previous thinkers to Wittgenstein who certainly seems to have set the language game paradigm with all of the associated issues. The reason it is important is because it helps define the various types of expertise as still further language games wherein certain kinds of vocabularies and axioms are part of the game. RememberPhilosophical Investigations, the nature of the certainty is the type of the language game. Harry Collins describes a vocabulary and language game that is necessary to organize the types of scientific expertise - so in a sense is a meta language about such languages. Since disputes in public media over scientific positions that are subject not only to expert debate but also democratic non-expert decision making processes, several interesting examples of which Harry Collins describes to make his points, this vocabulary ought to become part of our ubiquitous meta-expertise. Second, using the three wave model to describe the way science was viewed after WWII and scientists were the new priesthood, then science lost its divine position (and it seemed like everyone was equally a scientific expert) and Thomas Kuhn seemed to speak for this wave, and now we need a third wave where we recognize that scientists are people too but not everyone can speak as an expert unless they have reached a level of interactional expertise where few with tacit knowledge and 10,000 hours of practiceOutliers: The Story of Successof practice go. Also notice sheepherders are experts at sheepherding and not one of \"us.\" One critique I have is that practically everywhere Harry Collins refers to us as having each our own expertise in our jobs and our ubiquitous expertise - so that we can catch a liar in the act, so to speak. But I suspect for as much as a fourth of the population mental disabilities of one sort or another make this a false assumption. They certainly wouldn't be reading the book, but many of them vote! It is also interesting to me to think applying the various kinds of expertise with regard to other areas outside of gravitational waves, global weather, and vaccinations. Such academic areas as theology, religions, psychology, and many others. Harry Collins does not offer to extend his analyses in these other directions but consider the usefulness in doing that. I am thinking of Charles Taylor's idea inA Secular Ageregarding \"thin\" religions versus thick ones.

His words say one thing while his actions say the opposite.For example, he strikes out against capitalism. Yet, for twenty years he fought against every social program to help the poor - the reason left wing socialists in Argentina were so enraged by his election.Francis has been compared to John Paul I because both men defined their papacies as being for the poor. Yet, nothing could be further from the truth. John Paul - like Marx before him - would force (tax) the rich to help the poor.The Vatican Murders: The Life and Death of John Paul I. Francis - like Christ before him - would ask the rich to help the poor; something one knows does not work.Francis has also been compared to John Paul I concerning women in the Church. He has made it clear that women should aspire to high position. Consider his record.There are about 40 curial posts (a pope's cabinet) Secretary of State (Vice President), Prefecture of Economic Affairs (Chief Financial Officer) and Prefecture Apostolic Tribunal (Attorney General), etc. About 200 cardinals make up a pope's Senate. Concerning a pope's governors, 600 bishops rule the field.In the past year, in addition to taking women ordination off the table, Francis has confirmed a man to every single one of these positions together with over 800 deputies. No women allowed. Even the Supreme Court is a man (Francis).And why are no women allowed? Francis claims Christ chose only men for his cabinet. Not withstanding that only men wrote the gospels, what would the United States Congress be today if one considers only men made up its first Congress?At a time the most powerful nation in the world is looking forward to its first woman president, the Roman Catholic Church will not allow a woman to occupy the  lowest rung in its mainstream management.Francis says one thing to gain political favor, yet, does the opposite. He knows he can get away with this because - in his mind - he knows women are not too bright. He has very sound reason to think this way as more than half his congregation is women; women who have been condition since early childhood by his predecessors that little boys are better than little girls. He intends to keep it that way. The question is: When will little girls wake up to the fact they believe in a God that considers them subordinate human beings?Conversely, in his Sunday Angelus September 10, 1978, John Paul I declared: \"God is the Father. More so, the Mother.\" He was right. According to tales told by ancient 'men' God is a 'man'. Yet, according to all we really know, God is the Mother.  In 1978, the Church was not only looking at its first woman priest but it was looing at its first women cardinal. The thought of a woman pope would bring a smile to the lips of John Paul I; it strikes a dagger into the chauvinistic heart of Francis I. I know this will not win me a lot of votes. But it is the truth.Concerning women and a host of other issues John Paul told a symposium of cardinals: \"It is time for Mother Church to catch up to the world she lives in.\" One reason he was the youngest pope to die in four hundred years.The Vatican Murders: The Life and Death of John Paul Ianswers the question: Did his struggle for women, homosexuals and the poor cost him his life?Like other Francis' books `The Joy of the Gospel' discusses problems - no real solutions.The book I mention - though the only historical record of the 33-Day Pope - is not that well written.  The author had a rather hostile encounter with John Paul when he was a bishop of Vittorio Veneto which prompted him to write the book. It is a chronological record of the press that followed his every move from the time he became a bishop in 1958 until he was found dead in his bed in 1978.

He replies &#8220;Tucker&#8221;.Tucker is Riley&#8217;s estranged grandfather who she hasn&#8217;t seen in ten years because of an argument between her grandfather and father. Riley comes from a bloodline of warlocks and witches, but her father has never been willing to accept that. With the help of her grandfather&#8217;s transporting spell, Riley is able to go back in time; 1963 to be exact. Dean Archer is Riley&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s college roommate, and also the man that has been appearing in her dreams. The transporting spell is a success and Riley is able to go back and forth between past and present zones.I enjoyed the author&#8217;s idea and plot of time traveling. The visits to Riley&#8217;s dreams, the teasing for brief visits and tempting kisses exciting Riley to find this mystery man. However, Riley&#8217;s visits are often and lengthy; making for slow moments within the novel. Riley seems to forget about her present life and only wants to spend time with Dean in the past. Their relationship grows and they become fond of each other, but neither seems to try to prevent such an awkward relationship or they didn&#8217;t seem to put forth much effort to see what help Dean needed. I was basically wondering okay when will the pieces to the puzzle going to start fitting? While I enjoyed seeing the relationship between Riley and Dean grow, the sensible side of me kept wondering how this relationship could work. How will the author pull this off? Will Riley alter Dean&#8217;s original history? I was curious so I kept reading. Turns out I was very impressed that the author not only wrapped the story up but also included a villain to add some flare to the storyline. With determination, some spells and sacrifices the author did a wonderful job bringing this novel to a happy ending.Find Me is a fascinating time travel romance that I would recommend to those looking for something a bit different.

Even if you aren't a fan of either Dickens or Collins, this book is exciting enough on its own merits to interest readers who don't know and don't care about the two literary greats.For those readers who say it was too long, I say it's because Dan Simmons was truly channeling his inner Collins which could not be an easy feat.

Usually when you read about h's this young they are silly and making stupid decisions, all about the drama. Or the whining, self pity. She is not. She had been through things that have wounded her, but also made her stronger.  If it hadn't been written in the book that she was 20, I would have put her in her late 20's...and I actually think that would have been perfect for her, rather then not even drinking age.Can't wait for the next book!

It's still not the Persephone and Hades myth I was expecting, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Underworld definitely has more of the myth elements, and the new characters that are introduced are fantastic, but I'm still wishing there was a little more myth influence.John has taken Pierce away from the physical world and placed her in the safer Underworld. Here, at least, he can work to protect her from the Furies. In this, Underworld is like the Hades and Persephone myth. Pierce understands why John has done this, but that doesn't mean she likes it. She's a little in over her head with her new life and has trouble adjusting to the idea of leaving her old life behind. When she sees that her cousin Alex might be in trouble, all she wants to do is help him, not understanding the possible consequences.A few of my favorite parts of this novel were the cast of characters introduced in the Underworld. The shipmates John relies on to do his job are all interesting, funny characters and they provide a light note, especially little Henry. I wouldn't mind reading a book about the adventures this little group had gotten into. They were dynamic and really added something to the novel.The relationship between John and Pierce still feels a little off to me. Maybe it's because there hasn't been much focus on it, but things feel rushed and stiff. I don't see this love they proclaim to have for each other. A deep caring, I see. Love I don't. It makes it difficult for me to understand the reasoning behind some of their choices. There's still a lot of miscommunication and misunderstanding between them and even though I enjoy the sweet moments, I can't believe it's love. It just doesn't feel that way. I'm holding out hope that Awaken has the relationship development I'm looking for.I find myself confused by the major plot of Underworld as well. I'm not sure the part Alex and his misadventures will play in the overall storyline, but I do see pieces of a puzzle falling into place. That didn't stop me from being confused as to the Alex plot, though. It makes the novel feel as though it has split personality. Everything either has to do with the Underworld or with Alex, but not really both. I wish there was a better blend between the two.Underworld was closer to the Persephone and Hades myth I keep hoping for, but there are still things holding it back. The relationship between John and Pierce doesn't feel authentic yet and there's a little bit of a problem with the flow of the novel, in my opinion. Those issues don't stop it from being an enjoyable novel to read, though. I'm looking forward to finishing the series with Awaken and seeing how John and Pierce work together to figure out their lives in the Underworld.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not quite there yet", "unixReviewTime": 1388793600, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2014"}

As far as characters, there isn't anything really new or amazing. The setting is interesting and the alliances for the upcoming war prove the author spent some time with world building.Most of the &#34;plot twists&#34; were easy for me to predict. This isn't unusual. I'm a writer and a voracious reader. If you can trick me and have the proper groundwork in place to back up your twist, I'm impressed.For me, the allegory is too plain here. It isn't preachy yet, but I suspect it might become that way before the series is finished. Of course, this makes me want to check out the next book to see if I'm right.While this first installment in the series does seem to have a story problem that is resolved (find the wielder) it isn't the main character's problem. His problem is feeling like an outcast in his home reality and I guess that is resolved in the story. It seems pretty easily resolved to me. The plot is strong for the story but the character arc is weak.If you like quests, magic, elves, dragons and battle scenes, you will probably enjoy this book.

I adored this book!Successful attorney Teague Elliot has the world in the palm of his hand.  He&#8217;s just about to land the title of youngest partner in his uber successful Washington D.C. law firm and he couldn&#8217;t be happier.  Of course, this is just another stepping stone in his plan to enter the world of politics.  He&#8217;s also managed to keep his nose clean and the skeletons out of his closet his entire life in prep to take The Oval Office one day.  This brings us to the present&#8230;when he heads to Las Vegas with his friends and ends up in bed with a Vegas showgirl and absolutely no memory of why she&#8217;s here.  Or what he may have done the night before.  Will &#8220;what happens in Vegas&#8221; actually stay in Vegas?  Never has Teague needed it that saying to be more true than right now&#8230;.You could say that Risa Clay has taken the lemons life has handed her and made them into lemonade.  She didn&#8217;t have an easy childhood but has managed to make a pretty good life as a Las Vegas Showgirl and can&#8217;t really complain.  She certainly can&#8217;t complain when she wakes up to a sexy stranger after an unforgettable night.  But that&#8217;s just what she&#8217;d have to do&#8230;forget him.  Her best friend was in trouble and she had done last night as payment to her boss for borrowing money to help her best friend kick a nasty drug habit.  A shame, really, because this sexy stranger was positively delicious and they had an undeniable chemistry.  It&#8217;s this chemistry that prevents her from doing the last part of the payment for her boss and sends her fleeing Vegas&#8230;and showing up on her handsome one-night stand&#8217;s doorstep.So I&#8217;ll say it again&#8230;.these boys can come back to my town any time they&#8217;d like.  This book started out with a kick and just kept getting better with each chapter.  I couldn&#8217;t put it down!  Teague is straight laced, buckled up and not one to forget his end goal: The White House.  He&#8217;s worked hard and has dotted every &#8220;i&#8221; and crossed every &#8220;t&#8221; knowing full well that he didn&#8217;t want to deal with the hassle of a shady past.  Well, you know what they say about the best-laid plans.  Risa is exactly his opposite, a girl with a messy past and just living in the moment.  And this brings me to another saying: opposites attract! Fate has slammed these two together and never before has she gotten it more right.  Risa and Teague are so amazing together.  The push and pull between them is practically tangible, the chemistry between them palpable.  They&#8217;ve got quite a mess on their hands and fixing it proves to push them both to the limit, testing all emotions and crossing all sorts of lines. Did I mention I loved this book? Well, I did.  A lot.  Also, I have to mention that Robin writes some of the most amazing smexy scenes that I&#8217;ve ever read&#8230;.and I&#8217;ve read a whole lot of them.  There&#8217;s just something about her writing that gives her characters a little dash of more and it makes all the difference in adding to the heat factor!If you haven&#8217;t read the other books in the series, no worries, you can totally read this book as a stand-alone.

She is popular, belongs to a 'great' group of friends, and is also nominated to become the homecoming queen. Besides having a hectic home life, with her parents constant fighting - Kara does have one big love in her life that keeps her happy. Kara is a dancer. Dancing is practically her life, so when one tragic night a drunk driver hit her car and she comes out paralyzed - it feels like her entire world if about to fall apart.I found this book kind of empowering, and a story that I felt had to be shared. Kara wakes up in the hospital after the accident only to learn that she can no longer feel her legs. Dancing, as much as she loved it, is no longer something she is capable off. The life she once knew kind of started to slip from under her fingers and in that moment, Kara slowly learns not only who her true friends are but also how to deal with her life after a life changing injury.A really heart warming, touching story, that had me rooting for Kara along the way. I can't stand here and imagine how she must have truly felt, because I can't. But I think I can imagine. Watching Kara as she struggled at the beginning with getting use to her wheel chair, to the reactions some people had towards her. To the way her so called 'boyfriend' treated her. Seriously... That was the most disgusting part of the book. I won't go into spoilers, but I found him the worse kind of human being that I have read about in a while. Not only for not getting in touch with her after the accident, but he didn't even have the decency to check on her or call her?I did love how Kara's old friends stepped into play and took control of everything and made her life feel normal. Amanda and Jack were amazing and the way they treated Kara was absolutely inspirational. They took her in, despite Kara closing herself away from them and pushing them out of her 'new' circle of 'friends' and didn't even bat and eyeball. They made her feel as normal as possible while helping her move on, and the love was just there.A really tender and beautiful story.

Few of us would dare to be that brave and I admire Perry for writing this book. The story line is well written, easy flow and engages the reader.  Both my husband and I have read the book, my husband loved it so much due to the rich history of his home town, he read it twice.  I highly respect anyone that states they want to write a book...many state those words yet few take on such a hard task. I'm sure everyone will find this book engaging and at times heartfelt, tears forming with the values Perry has learned through his lifetime. He is really not the \"Lost Flower(s)\" because Perry Sullivan is a trustworthy man that had no say so in his birth. He was and remains innocent in that decision made by two adults...in this case, two adults that apparently cared/loved each other???  However, to judge Perry for their actions would be like someone judging you for something your loved one did and you had \"nothing\" to do with their decision(s). With that, I admire, appreciate his contribution to the world of words, the Author World where we learn through other's experiences. His book is a story of his bloodline and his heritage.

I was interested in reading Henry's story after being introduced to his character in Sydney's story. I was slightly disappointed to say the least. There were so many scenes that had me scratching my head in confusion. The idea that Henry was so in love with Sydney that he thought his life was over because she rejected him to fall completely and madly in love with Renee so quickly and profess more then once that he had no feelings what so ever for Sydney seemed a little far fetched to me. The fact the he was honest with Renee and told her about his feelings for someone else and her be okay with it and want to be with him anyway didn't seemPlausible...I kept thinking in my head what woman would do that. Some of the sex scenes had me skimming...especially the masterbation ones. I didn't understand why Henry would feel like a pervert for being attracted to someone other then Sydney. I can understand him struggling with it because of his feelings, having feelings for two people at the same time but to feel like a pervert because of that was a little odd to me.

While i have created a separate review for this, I have also included it at the end of this review for Tyndale.&#8220;What happens when you discover you&#8217;re more like Jesus than you think?&#8221;This is the basis behind prototype. God loves us. God created us. What if Jesus were more than just our savior? What if Jesus is the prototype for humanity, to show us what we should be like? What if we tried to do more than just &#8216;follow&#8217; him?Each chapter in Prototype covers a different theme, ranging from  identity, to obscurity to resurrection, to witness. These same themes are also covered in the DVD small group guide, which I also wanted.&#8220;Many times in the Old Testament, God refers to human beings as His beloved. But when God called Jesus His beloved, Jesus did something truly remarkable. He believed Him. And He lived every moment of His life fully convinced of his identity.&#8221; (page 16)While the first chapter focuses specifically on identity, it&#8217;s a theme carried throughout the book. Who are you in Christ? It is an issue that Martin deals with well, through anecdotes and scripture. This is not necessarily a book for everyone. Those who feel like they have their life together may feel disinterested in much of what Martin feels. But those who are struggling may find hope. I know that not every part resonated with me, but Martin writes with conviction, and I certainly hope his writing can help those who are struggling.&#8220;&#8230;Jesus&#8217; path to kingship comes wrapped in a very odd strategy indeed: He is the King of kings largely because he lets himself get beat up. He is victorious not despite His scars, but because of them.&#8221; (page 93)One of the strongest chapters in the book is &#8220;Wounds.&#8221; Martin writes about how Jesus was mocked, beaten, and crucified. What do we make of this, he asks. Our God did not come to earth with a sword in hand. Rather his blood was drawn by his enemies and he was nailed to a cross to die. Of all the chapters in the book, I feel that this one has the most potential to resonate with people.The chapter that resonated most with me was &#8220;Sacraments.&#8221;  A large part of its focus is on the humanity of Jesus. While on earth He could be touched. A sick woman could grasp his robe and He healed her, and others. Not only did he heal them, but he touched them. Who would&#8217;ve ever thought that they could ever be touched by a god, especially since they were often considered unclean or sinful? Martin also covers Baptism, the washing of feet, and Communion, showing the joining of the spiritual and the physical.I mentioned earlier that I also had the chance to watch the small group DVD. While it does not always go as deep as the book, it still covers the same themes.  Each segment is 20 minutes long, with a discussion break halfway through. A small guide for the group leader is also included, with suggestions for formatting and questions.Each segment focuses largely on Martin, as he stands and addresses the camera. He seems earnest and humble, and is quite easy to listen to. As he tells stories or teaches the message he wants to convey, his words are intercut with video illustration and you can hear the passion in his voice. Usually the illustration follows a single character throughout the session, though not every session features the same characters.On a production standpoint, they videos are well done. Locations are varied, and the illustrating videos have almost a flashback or dreamlike quality. The audio is crisp, and even when the wind is blowing Martin&#8217;s hair I never had to strain to hear them. Visually they often reminded me of Rob Bell&#8217;s Nooma series.If you&#8217;ve already read Prototype, the content in the video series is redundant, but if you have small group to participate in, I believe that it could prompt strong discussion about the topics. Like the book, I found Sacrament to be my favorite sectionLooking over the discussion questions, the effectiveness of this material may vary depending on each group. If you&#8217;re group is shy, or has a hard time revealing information about themselves, they may struggle to answer all of the questions. This isn&#8217;t to say that people should not stretch themselves, just that not everyone can. A group that enjoys digging into material and that stays focused most of the time may be able to more fully engage the material.This might also be a good series for those who are new to Christianity. Martin does not deal with the large theological terms, but instead seeks to be understandable by all. I think his honesty, and especially sections such as &#8216;Wounds and Resurrection&#8217; and &#8216;Obscurity and Calling&#8217; would resonate with those who have mainly been exposed to the fundamentalist side of Christianity.4/5 StarsI received this book free from Tyndale.

Kyle is outgoing, boisterous and just plain fun to be around .. the life of any party. His twin Derek however, is the shy, quiet, romantic type. Derek is the sensible and responsible one, where Kyle is the crazy, die hard partier.One of the boys is over the top in love with Katie, but Katie is over the top in love with the other. It has always been this way.  Katie somtimes thinks that she should go for the one who loves her (since they look exactly alike after all), but the heart wants what the heart wants.The two finally find their way to each other as Katie always dreamed, until tragedy strikes. Over powering, gut wrenching tragedy. This tragedy places a wedge between the young lovers and they each wonder if they will ever make it back to one another.

I don't know what historical errors she has made (some people have criticised her as an historian), but if they're matters of detail then that doesn't worry me.I also enjoyed the \"alternativeness\" of her overview. It was interesting to read about the perspectives of women, lower castes, minorities, non-mainstream religious movements and the like, and it was interesting to see how attitudes have changed over the years towards animals. Having read Hinduism and Indian philosophies largely through the well known texts it's just as well for me to know that Sanskritizing Brahmins weren't the only people shaping Hindu philosophy and practice; there were subaltern voices getting through as well.I particularly appreciated her sense of humour and somewhat amused and skeptical evaluation of much that is sacralised in the Hindu traditions. I suppose for devout Hindus that could appear as disrespectful, and I can understand the negative reactions of many Hindus on that account. However, I don't have a dog in this fight and tend to be skeptical of religious self-promotion, too, so it was not an issue for me.I'm just a bit surprised I got through such a long and detailed book, and, that when I'd finished and put it down, I felt I was parting from something and someone who meant something to me.

Grisham is one of my favorite authors and I totally did not expect this book, &#34;Water's Edge&#34; by Robert Whitlow, to live up to that sort of expectation. But it did.Part of the reason was I started the book while still living overseas. Then life in W. Africa happened: a war next door started, internet died, hot season and tons of power outages exhausted, a kid graduated, we moved internationally, I dove back into that phenomenon of worse culture shock coming home than going there...So I started the book, stopped when life happened - and couldn't get back into it because I couldn't find where I'd left off and was having a hard time wading through the vague familiarity of having already read the first several chapters. It finally took knowing that my review deadline date (or else I'd lose my status as a book reviewer) was rapidly approaching to motivate me to just sit down and read the book.I'm so glad I did... and thinking I'm gonna go find another one of his action/suspense legal dramas and check it out. I thoroughly enjoyed this read.Tom Crane, an up and coming lawyer living the good life in the big city loses his dad, his job and his girl in relatively quick succession. Then, while back in the small town where he grew up attempting to close up and tie up all the loose ends from his father's law practice, he runs into curious circumstances: a mysterious trust fund without clear documentation, unexplained details concerning his father's accidental drowning while out fishing with a friend, an unexpected friend in the daughter of that other man who also died in the accident, an eccentric spiritual warrior uncle, uncomfortable situations with trusted and long time family friends... and last but not least, an unforeseen and lifechangingly powerful intimate encounter with God.Tom Crane thinks he gets it all figured out and is ready to move on, ready for the next step accepting a great job offer from another big law firm in the big city. I was all set for the &#34;drama&#34; to predictably settle and for the last bit of the book to turn into a sappy Christian romance...We were both surprised and survived! The last quarter of the book was much better than just good!

Shifter lore allows the love at first sight (or scent) idea to seem credible, and it legitimizes lots of steamy romance scenes.Deputy sheriff Daisy Picou, a bear shifter, is working security at a County Fair when she sees lion shifter Ram Reinhardt performing with the popular rock band, Saber. Although she is immediately and intensely attracted to Ram, Daisy resists that attraction mightily. She already had her heart broken once by a lion shifter, and she has no desire to go down that road again.While singing with the band, Ram couldn't help but notice Deputy Picou. When he tries to hook up with Daisy, she fends him off like the strong female that she is. Ram realizes that he will need patience and persistence if he is to persuade her to quit resisting so that they can start living their HEA as mates.Daisy and Ram are both likeable characters.

But I have to say, my favorite ones would be this series here by Rachel Hauck. I was able to review the first book last year and this one was actually my favorite out of the two. You just gotta love a southern Florida gal being whisked away and becoming a princess:)Regina, or Reggie as she likes to be called, is at her best. She restores vintage classic cars with her buddies. Then enters Tanner. Ponytail and all:) He informs her that she is a long lost princess who needs to come restore her nation. I have to admit, this would be a tough decision. The known to the unknown. Her dream life to life in the spotlight. But she makes the decision she feels her grandmother would have and what God is telling her to do. So she flies across and takes in the sights, all the while trying to make the right choice. Needless to say, there are funny parts, awesome parts, and even some parts that will bring tears to your eyes. Tanner is a pretty good hero even with all his flaws. But my favorite person was Regina. I guess maybe I connected with her being a southern Florida gal myself. Oh, and if you have read the first book, you will recognize some of the characters from it.Again, an excellent story that is humorous and thought provoking.

She has some growth to go through before she really gets to a place where we can really love her.  She has to realize a lot of things and come to terms with how she&#8217;s changed.  Fortunately she&#8217;s a good person and while maybe a bit blind to some things initially, she slowly opens up to different people and new situations.  Even though she&#8217;s not the most likable person at the start, I never felt that strong feeling of dislike.  I just saw that she was a bit naive and not totally seeing things very well.  She never really drove me nuts, even when I knew her decisions were not the smartest.  Fortunately she has a wonderful friend in Bianca who is there for her the entire way, always speaking up when Lainey is not thinking clearly, or clearly making the wrong choice about something.Micah is Lainey&#8217;s co-worker and the perfect person to be her fake boyfriend since his girlfriend recently broke up with him.  So they can trade the favor.  Micah is really not Lainey&#8217;s type at all.  She&#8217;s the sporty popular girl and he&#8217;s the guy with the mohawk and tattoos.  But as they get to know each other they realize they have more in common than they thought.  I really liked how Micah was not a bad guy and kind of shows that not every guy with a mohawk and tattoos is out breaking the law.  Well, if they are it might just be over something kind of silly.The secondary characters were done very well.  Her parents weren&#8217;t real present but the descriptions of them and the little we saw of them made their personalities very bold and easy to remember.Romance~  I think it&#8217;s pretty easy to figure out what is going to happen, but it was such a fun ride watching it unfold.  There&#8217;s no insta-love as the two spend time together at work as well as on their &#8216;dates&#8217;.  They seemed to be tied together even better by the common goal and in the end it benefited them.  It was super sweet and I loved this romance!Plot~ There&#8217;s not too much to add here since it&#8217;s a pretty simple one.  But I liked that there were little issues added in.  Lainey realizing that her ex and one of her friends was not all she thought they were.  Coming to terms with the fact that she was a bit judgmental of others.Negatives~  I wish we&#8217;d seen a bit more of Lainey&#8217;s parents.  They were so well crafted, I just wanted to see more of them.  I also felt like her friend Bianca was always there for her for everything she went through but somehow she was missing a lot of the time.  I think I would have liked to see a bit more of her.  All these are pretty small little issues though.This was a super fast and fun read.  The last half of the book was hard for me to put down.

It has been a roller coaster of action and adventure. Episode 5 had no significant typos or confusing sentences; maybe one so I would call it perfect.The action slows down. Some parts become a bit boring, but this is science fiction and explaining or rather giving examples of how a fighter would train for space engagements is par for the course. As everything has slowed down there is more reflection on how long they have actually been out in this particular part of space which I feel adds needed perspective. Also contemplating their actions as their main duty is to get back to earth keeps fresh in one's imagination how far this series still has to go.The characters are developing and changing through their experiences which keeps the human factor alive. Some of the back stories on the characters could have been written more dynamically. For instance a man cutting open his chest out of loyalty, just don't state it describe it more graphically to add some real gut wrenching.There is a great emphasis on tactics and politics which adds to the reality of this world the author has created.

Virtually every character is shaded in gray as is the key incident involving Aziz and Miss Quested.Some of the more overtly racist and vile personnel of the British Raj lament during different points in the novel that they're essentially there for the good of the Indian population; the ends justify any and all brutal means according to their self-serving justifications.  They're bringing civilization to the backward masses, no more no less.  Which of course is a timeworn clich&eacute; ranging from Manifest Destiny in Latin America with the United States to the French in Indochina and the Dutch in Southeast Asia.  Since the European invasion swept the world over 500 years ago it has never gotten old in the minds of some.A nebulous ethical and moral background cloud Forster's work on almost every page.  Forster himself once remarked that even he wasn't totally sure as to what exactly occurred in the Marabar between Aziz and Miss Quested and that this deliberate use of vagueness acts as a parallel to what many aspects of India were like for the colonizing personnel.  The subject population is not immune.  At one point Aziz, the Muslim, remarks about his sometimes strained relationship with the majority Hindu population that &#34;It is useless discussing Hindus with me.  Living with them teaches me no more.  When I think I annoy them, I do not.  When I think I don't annoy them, I do.&#34;Fielding himself is clouded in ambiguity.  He steadfastly supports Aziz believing he&#8217;s innocent against the appalling allegations but at different times harbors stereotypical views that powerful Brits cling to regarding the natives.  Ruminating that they always do something disappointing, he then goes on to cite a single instance of pilferage and Aziz fleeing from the authorities.Running throughout the novel various members of the British Raj are reminded from time to time that they&#8217;re only seeing a tiny sliver of India, that only a certain segment of it has ever been opened up to them, that a portion of India will forever remain enigmatic. In this way &#8216;A Passage to India&#8217; remains as a piece of literature that at its core keeps the heart of the story in a crucible of non-clarity to strengthen its theme of powerful philistines and their ultimately unsuccessful attempt at hegemony over an inscrutable land.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Imprecision of British India", "unixReviewTime": 1396915200, "reviewTime": "04 8, 2014"}

It was a burst in the sky that gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. The awed public started calling them Epics.But Epics are no friend of man. With incredible gifts came the desire to rule. And to rule man you must crush his wills.Nobody fights the Epics... nobody but the Reckoners. A shadowy group of ordinary humans, they spend their lives studying Epics, finding their weaknesses, and then assassinating them.And David wants in. He wants Steelheart&#8212;the Epic who is said to be invincible. The Epic who killed David's father. For years, like the Reckoners, David's been studying, and planning&#8212;and he has something they need. Not an object, but an experience.He's seen Steelheart bleed. And he wants revenge.My Quick Recap:When David was a child, he was the only survivor of a brutal attack on a bank by the Epic known as Steelheart. Epics have super powers, but no one is exactly sure how they got them, or why certain people are chosen and not others. What David does know is that Epics beat mankind into submission, and the fearful life mankind leads is not the life he wants any longer. Unfortunately, the man who killed his father and the epic who David wants revenge on, is the invincible Steelheart. At least, everyone thinks Steelheart is invincible. But David knows a secret, a secret that Steelheart himself killed to have buried. David knows Steelheart has a weakness. He just has to figure out what it is.There are so many fantastic things about this book. There was not a dull moment. You can&#8217;t honestly say that about many books. Even the &#8220;down time&#8221;, Sanderson is revealing something extremely interesting, or vitally important to the plot.David is a great hero. He&#8217;s impulsive, yet extremely intelligent, focused (sometimes too focused) and he uses those attributes to aid a rebel group known as The Reckoners. David has a lot of emotional baggage to wade through, and it was interesting to see him come to terms with the darker parts of him that have been driving him his entire life. Fortunately, those parts drove him directly to the Reckoners. Each one of the Reckoners was interesting, had their own obvious strengths and weaknesses and were distinctive people. I was intrigued by Megan, and her back story; I really liked her character and was thrilled with the direction Sanderson took her. I had similar feelings for Prof; it was through his character that I feel the reader sees where the series is headed the most, which was fun and exciting to see. So many books these days have secondary characters that just sort of blend in with the crowd. Sanderson creates a group of people who are each memorable in their own way.The Epics were an interesting sci-fi device. They had an infinite range of abilities and weaknesses. The long trek to figure out Steelheart&#8217;s weakness was stressful, as I had absolutely no idea what it could be. The great thing about Sanderson&#8217;s writing is as you&#8217;re moving along, he gives options for explanations for things that seem perfectly reasonable. And then he unveils the actual explanation, showing how brilliant of a writer he is. Steelheart&#8217;s weakness was one of those brilliant moments, where my jaw dropped and I started laughing because I couldn&#8217;t handle the awesome.There were other similar moments, but I really don&#8217;t want to give anything away, so I&#8217;ll just leave it at that.There are other fun sci-fi elements, such as cool tech, ridiculously huge guns, etc.One of the biggest reasons I love the writing in Steelheart is because it&#8217;s written so cinematically; you can really imagine it being on a big screen (and I&#8217;d be shocked if it doesn&#8217;t get snapped up by a production company this year, if it hasn&#8217;t been already). The stakes are as high as they can be, and Sanderson doesn&#8217;t hold anything back. There were plenty of times where I was left thinking, &#8216;did he REALLY just do that??&#8217; The action scenes are incredibly well written, and they are extensive in the best way imaginable, which is not always the case in YA fiction.This is a great YA book for guys (in my opinion, as I myself am not a guy) since the protagonist is a really great guy character; I highly recommend it for girls as well though, since its just such dang good writing (fear not girls, there are some romance elements. Not a full blown romance, but its there, trust me).

The government officials are busy proclaiming that there is no gang violence and their streets are clean while all along getting kick-backs from a large crime syndicate called Fathers Disciples.  No one knows who they are and no one is really sure where they came from.  Signs seem to point to Fathers House, a home for wayward boys, run by &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Mayo Fathers.  Is this pillar of the community really a front for a massive criminal empire?  Who can you trust when everyone seems to be on the take?Ben Lovison is an assistant in the District Attorney&#8217;s office who is given a case to prosecute that involved a savage beating death of a boy who lives at Fathers House by another of his peers, one who also lives at Fathers House.  Ben has a history with Fathers House; he is one of their success stories.  After the brutal murder of his mother, he is taken in by Uncle Mayo and he not only survives, he thrives.  He graduates high school, college and law school.  What should be a simple open and closed case becomes anything but.  With twists and turns along the way, Ben slowly comes to realize that there is something dark lurking in Fathers House and through the streets of Duraleigh.The story builds very slowly and for readers who don&#8217;t have the patience to let the story build, they will probably become disinterested after a few chapters.  There are a lot of characters and it&#8217;s very hard to keep them all straight, some of them are unfortunately very interchangeable and that really ends up taking away from what really is a very well written story.  The plot is strong, and the twists are unexpected for the most part.  But the characters tend to get in the way.  I think if the cast was pared down a bit and more was done to identify and flesh out some of the more important characters it would have worked much better.Once you make it past the first few chapters, the story really begins to move quickly through the twists and turns and the author does finally connect all the dots together to make a more coherent picture.  I&#8217;m not sure if this was the intention of the author to have so many threads dangling out in the wind and then have them all tied together by the climax, but that&#8217;s definitely how it seemed to me.  It was really rough at first to try and keep all the threads straight and try to remember who was who and what side were they really on, but in the end I think it all worked out.  Satisfying climax though it was rather fast, a blink and you miss it type.Fathers House has a solid plot with some really solid characters, both good and evil.  Too many characters did detract a bit for me and some of them really didn&#8217;t lend much to the story itself other than to connect a dot later on.  But that&#8217;s just one person&#8217;s opinion.  This is an independently published novel if I remember correctly and while it might turn a lot of people off if it doesn't come from a big name publishing company, this novel was very well edited, very few errors and the formatting was better than I've seen in many, many independently published books.  Even the cover was interesting!

Of course at that time I felt it imperative that I share my thoughts with the author so I put the book down and started typing, emotions overtaking the words I sent to her.

However, I can't (or won't) read books when there is cheating (either by H or h), cliffhangers, domestic violence, humiliation and degradation, crazy angst, or when books are populated by people who are TSTL.  Unfortunately, this rules out most MC books because they're usually much too gritty (perhaps realistic, but I don't need that much realism in my romance novels), overpopulated by skanks, the H usually cheats, the h is usually a stupid doormat who is treated poorly, and there's some crazy dark themes that run through them.  If you don't like those elements in your books but you still love the concept of a MC and lurve alpha males like I do, then this is a good book for you to read.pros (spoilers may be contained):* no cheating!  (yay!)  This is one of those books where the H sees the h and it's over for him.  Finito!  Doesn't even look at another woman - he's all about the h.* no cliffhanger (double yay!)  I HATE cliffhanger books.  I'm soooo tired of trilogies that take years to come out and you're stuck with a cliffhanger that leaves you with a book hangover and sobbing because you have no resolution.* the h is pretty cool.

It's in the first person, there are a lot of descriptions about clothing, there's a super smitten alpha man, and the h is in danger.  If you like KA books, you'll like this one.

The characters are absolutely amazing, the worlds that collide between the colonies and Rebuplic is flawless, and the entire book is just impossible to put down it is so good. My favorite part of the book was actually Ross City, Antartica. I absolutely adored this new world Lu created just outside the Republic's window.

I understand that both Day and June were having very hard times, but it seemed every other sentence either Day or June's heard was &#34;shattered&#34;, or &#34;torn&#34;, or &#34;ripped open&#34;, and someone was always crying. I understand that it makes sense, but I thought it was a bit much.2. I did not like the final twist at the end of the book. I will not spoil anything, but just say that I felt Day lost everything he had grown to be in Legend in Prodigy. His character had matured so much, he had grown as a character and as a person, and I did not like that all that was just wiped away.Other than those two things, this book still deserves 6/5 stars because it was just AMAZING.I would defienlty recommend reading it, because even though I didn't like the final twist, there is another chapter after that twist that leaves the reader wanting to know exactly what will happen, but you know that the path is &#34;in the light&#34; and is a nice resolution (although I wanted more) to this stunning series.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "AMAZING", "unixReviewTime": 1389571200, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2014"}

Seemingly all the hotels and shops at Lourdes have religious names, and it is startling to see a shop selling tacky souvenirs that is named after Charles de Foucauld, who lived in extreme poverty in the desert, or, worse, a knickknack shop under a sign proclaiming L'Immacule&eacute; Conception.\" (Pg. 27-28)He says, \"After Mass in the ornate basilica, someone suggests a visit to the grotto, which I had assumed was far-off. But the church is built directly atop the rocky outcropping, and when i go around the corner and pass huge racks of tall white candies for sale, I am shocked to come upon it... as I approach I am drawn to the obvious peace of the place... Hundreds of people are gathered before the space... Many stand in line to walk through the grotto. Joining them, I run my hand over the smooth wet rock and am astonished to spy the spring uncovered by Bernadette. I am filled with wonder at being here.\" (Pg. 29-30)Two days later, he recalls, \"I am waiting for a turn at the baths. On long wooden benches under a stone portico sit the 'malades,' along with their companions and other pilgrims. Flanking me are two men from our pilgrimage with the Order of Malta... Carved in the stone wall are the Virgin's words to Bernadette: 'Go drink of the waters and bathe yourself there.' Every few minutes an 'Ave Maria' is sung in another language. After an hour, the three of us are called into a small room surrounded by blue and white striped curtains. Once inside we strip to our undershorts and wait patiently on plastic chairs... Inside a small chamber three men stand around a sunken stone bath... One volunteer points to a wooden peg, and after I hang my undershorts, he quickly wraps a cold wet towel around my waist. ('I think they kept it in the freezer for us!' says one of the malades at lunch.) Another volunteer carefully guides me to the lip of the bath and asks me to pray for the healing I need...Two of them gently take my arms and lead me down the steps into the bath, where the water was cold, but no colder than a swimming pool... Here, praying in this dimly lit room, in this spring water, held by two kind people, I feel entirely separated from the rest of my life. It's a kind of mini-retreat... And then---whoosh---they stand me up and point to a small statue of Mary, whose feet I kiss. Then I'm handed a quick drink of water from a pitcher... After the bath, i rush over to the Grotto of Massabielle, where our group is celebrating Mass. And, yes, the water dries from my skin immediately.\" (Pg. 41-43)This book is an excellent, yet brief, account of a modern pilgrimage to the site.  For those who can't/won't travel there themselves, the book does an excellent job of capturing the \"atmosphere.\"", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A JESUIT PRIEST TELLS OF HIS OWN PILGRIMAGE", "unixReviewTime": 1395273600, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2014"}

Some of the revamping works, others do not.  in my book, due to the crispness of the writing and simple well drawn art, This title is a major hit. Combining such characters as Shade the Changing Man, Madame Xanadu, Deadman, Zatanna, Mindwarp and John Constantine in a warp little team is something to show interest.Since I did not the comic monthly, this title is an interesting pair of horror title sheroes. It focus more of the character ability to move this story. The story makes for good reading, a Supernature force that the SUPERHEROES (Superman,Wonder Woman and Batman) cant handle..and how this force of misfit heroes work as a team.

It was FAR from my normal read and I was not expecting what Jessica produced. I have read almost ALL of JS' books and with each one I get a new experience and I do not get the same thing over and over. Even with all her romance novels, with each one, there is a different aspect to it and I am always left wondering if this author has any kind of life or is she a super human that can just knock out a novel in a short amount of time. I don't know what it is but if she keeps producing books like she does, then I'm not complaining.Although, I do want to go out and buy her lots of drinks and a night out where she isn't sitting hunched over a computer letting characters run rapid through her fingertips!Anyway, back to the story. I really was not expecting what I got with this book. It was a lot more than I expected and it was creepy as crap!!! I am also a big scaredy cat and it was probably not wise of me to read this in the middle of the night!! At one point, I threw my kindle down and got a drink of water because I was freaked the freak out!! When I got my nerves under control, I finished and was left more confused and with more questions than while I was reading.There were so many \"WTFs\" uttered through this book that I didn't know if I was ever going to figure the mystery out and then when it all ended, I still didn't know WTF was going on. I am not going to put the questions I asked myself at the end because it will give the story away and I would hate to do that to anyone interested in reading this. But if I could describe this book in one word, it would be CRAZY!!!Now, since a couple days have passed and I am STILL thinking about this book, I have finally figured out what JS was trying to do. Where she took these character\"s\" because if my  (almost) degree in Psychology has taught me anything, it's people will learn to cope with traumatic events anyway they can. What Maddie did and experienced is enough to make anyone lose their poop and she definitely lost her s***.

Clarissa is a \"ruined\" spinster whose elopement ended in abandonment by her groom, disownment by her family, and had her in the position of housekeeper for a distant cousin for the last five years. When the cousin died, the new owner of the estate dismissed her, so she answered an offer to be a governess in the Caribbean to the daughter of a sugar plantation owner, an acquaintance of the cousin. She is an active abolitionist and her plan is to secretly research how slaves are treated, first hand, so she can write an expose about it when she returns to England in a few years. The ship is owned by her new employer, and is bringing supplies to the plantation, so there are only a few passengers, all headed to the same island. On her ship, she meets the youngest son of an Earl, who is a solicitor. Allen is traveling to the island to a neighboring plantation to inform his father of the death of his mother and the Earl's wife. Also traveling with them are the newly wed overseer of the Lemarchand plantation, Clarissa's destination, and his wife, who appears to have run a brothel prior to her wedding to Blight, the overseer. Lovely, refined folks they are not. The Blights get horrible seasickness, so instead of Allen and Mr Blight sharing one cabin and Clarissa and Mrs Blight sharing the other, Allen and Clarissa end up sharing a very small cabin.... This is where the story starts to vere off from traditional regency romances.There is quite a lot of energetic sexual activity between Clarissa and Allen, but no promises for the future or declarations of love. When they get to the island, they meet Mr Lemarchand, more commonly known as March. There is a lot of historically accurate information included in the descriptions of life on the plantation and the jobs and treatment of slaves, both at March's plantation and at the Earl's. March is attractive and attracted to Allen and to Clarissa. This definitely is not your typical regency romance. There are some very racy scenes between March and Allen, March and Clarissa-whom he makes his mistress, in addition to being the governess-, and between all three of them. Ai-yi-yi! There are some serious abuses of power by Blight and some interesting plot twists that kept me engaged until the end.I didn't know if I liked either of the male \"heroes\" all that much at first meeting them. Allen was sarcastic and tended towards rudeness, he wasn't sure what he was doing with his life, he had no purpose. He managed to overcome all that, even though he went through a horrible ordeal, he really \"found\" himself, was able to verbalize his emotions and gained a perspective about his past and a purpose for his future. March started off with the strikes against him of being a slave owner who really didn't know what went on in his own properties, and he believed everything that Blight told him. He was rather arrogant as well. As the story progressed, March emerged as a man who knew his days were numbered and wanted to have people around him who loved him and would care for his daughter. He liked to be in charge of the few things that he still could be, and really loved extravagantly, even if unrequited. Clarissa, too, gained a lot of knowledge about herself and her capacity for love and different definitions for love. She was able to gain the trust of some of the slaves and get information for her expose and she was able to make a difference in the life of her charge as a governess.I ended up really liking the story, even though I started out unsure. It was certainly different, and not for the kiddies or those looking for a \"clean\" read.

The summary includes blurbs about each individual story.**ARC received on behalf of Kensington Books from NetGalley**Overall Book Rating: 3.5 StarsWhat I Loved About Each Story:Fired Up- I thought this was a great way to start off the book and it was also my favorite of the three. I immediately enjoyed reading about Hannah and her sexual adventures with Cole. I could not imagine coming face to face with my fantasy lover after the games they were playing especially thinking he would never show up at her front door step. I think it is super hot and very alpha that he went out to her watchtower to check in on her and his first sight of her was from a distance, watching her bathe in a waterfall. From that moment on, I couldn't keep me eyes off of the page. After wrapping up this story, I wanted more of Hannah and Cole.\"What if I want to take the chance, want to see if we could have something more? What if I want more than just the nights?\"Sizzle- While Fired Up was very arousing and sensual, Sizzle was cuddly and flirtatious. First of all, where do I get her job shooting delicious fireman for an article and calendar? I thought it was charming watching Maysen chase after Clay to get him to participate in her project. Despite being burned previously by a woman who was only in town for a short time, Clay opens himself to Maysen. Overall, it is a very delightful story with a little bit of drama and a happy ending.\"You look like you want to devour me,\" he said, low and husky. She wouldn't lie to him about the way she felt. \"I do.\" \"That is handy, since I want to devour you too.\"Five-Alarm Masquerade- While this story was entertaining; it was my least favorite of the three. I felt the story was rushed and jumped all over the place. Abby house catches on fire and destroys all of her pictures of her family. For some reason, Abby sticks out to Gavin, the fireman who helps soothe her after the fire. After that, the story takes a weird turn and gets to be slightly farfetched. This story deals with a heavy story line for a short story. There is so much going on for Abby and Gavin that the author needed more time to really develop each character and to me, that is why the story felt rushed and lacking.\"Seeing you like this tempts me to want to keep you here all night,\" he murmured against her flesh, trailing his nose along her skin and inhaling deeply. \"To do incredibly naughty things to this sexy body, for as long as I want.\"Read this review and more at [...]", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Turn the hose on me...

LambColonel Mark Coolhand Reynolds is behind closed doors in a psych ward being given meds that will hopefully erase his memory. Many other combat soldiers both officers and enlisted men are among the patients in this hospital being given these drugs. Entering the halls you see them carrying a special project notebook having to add their thoughts and notes before begin allowed to leave their daily meeting. As each person leaves he/she is told to stand in line and get their meds. But, Mark is smart, realizes what is happening and hides the meds within his cheeks and never swallows anything. The year is 2011 the month is December as the story flashes back several years to where it all began. Just what does the government want him and others to forget? Why are they going to such lengths to keep these people you might say in captivity? What will happen if he finally escapes? A Dangerous Element is the work of retired USAF Colonel Gregory S. Lamb and will bring you up close and personal into Iran, its borders and smack in the middle of their nuclear weapons development program. Readers will learn just how they plan to develop the weapons, the materials used and how one Mossad agent and one Iranian scientist work together but for different reasons to help Iran become a nuclear power. An undercover and top-secret weapon, which was developed by DARPA, is an integral part of what is about to be revealed.The Iranians have developed an nuclear enrichment program at Natanz, which Israel and the United States wants destroyed. An American covert operation to take it down goes bad when a virus that has been placed in the facility&#8217;s closed control network is found.&#8232;&#8232;Former combat pilot, Colonel Mark &#34;Coolhand&#34; Reynolds holds the key to unraveling the cast of shady characters involved in the operation and cover up. In doing so, he becomes a target of another top-secret weapon developed by DARPA. With Iran threatening retribution and the start of a thermonuclear war, Coolhand doesn't have time to fix things the right way.Author Gregory S. Lamb, a retired USAF Colonel, has drawn upon a wealth of personal knowledge and experience to create this believable, contemporary, military thriller. With a strong protagonist, and interesting cast of support characters, Lamb takes the reader on a roller coaster ride involving a compromised US plot to disable Iran&#8217;s nuclear enrichment facilities, an attempted government cover-up, and enough action and intrigue to make the book hard to put down.&#8232;Dr.Farrouck &#8220;Reza,&#8221; Khedem decided to enter a ten-kilometer event sponored by a group of runners from the University of Isfahan. Whether by accident, fate happenstance, he becomes friends with another runner named Heydar. A strong friendship ensued as they decided to workout together on a regular basis and a solid trust came about. But, who is friend really is and where he works provides a strong element of suspense for readers.While their friendship developed Mark Reynolds was placed at Langley Air Force Base where he presented of a program he created called FACE or Fighter Aircraft Communications Enhancement. Briefing in front of the Major General Glazer who welcomed him with accolades for his work would send him to many bases all over the world.Next we find Reza on the track with his new friend Heydar and as their friendship becomes stronger he explains the changes the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran is undergoing and temporarily moving his projects closer to the research and development nuclear reactor near the &#8220;Isfhan campus.&#8221; With his wife finally leaving Tehran, his life seeming on the right path Reza had no idea that that things were about to take a different turn. Heydar had his own agenda and working with the CIA and other agents his job was to find a way to infiltrate and learn how to control and command the Natanz facility. Learning the possibilities of point entry was vital and just how he hoped would come from his friend Reza. Discussing with his friend his role in Iran&#8217;s uranium enrichment techniques he hoped to come up with a plan that would destroy what ever the Iranians were doing and hopefully not get caught. But, others whom he thought were working with him would soon learn were using him until the job was done. As we once again meet Snake or Wormwood his affiliation with him was limited and whose role lethal.The catalyst for what would happen will surprise you and the technology used everyone wishes they had access too. Not everyone would notice changes in their computer codes or extra information flashing across their screens.  Hiding in plain sight is someone close to the others and what happens is more than explosive.A virus placed inside the computer network of an Iranian uranium facility and those responsible in the US government have to find a way to cover it up. Coolhand realizes that is might be the only one that can unravel this mess but first he needs to disappear, go off the radio and find a way to stop what the President of Iran has planned.Finding his way from Afghanistan, Cyrus, Virginia and across the globe the author takes readers inside Natanz, in the mind of a rogue CIA agent named Snake, and allows us to see first hand the depths to which we will go to take down an adversary as you read Chapter 18 and learn exactly what others experienced when the virus hit. But, Mark finally escapes Bethesda and finds himself in need of help. But, just how Coolhand manages to evade his captures and find his way to some type of freedom is quite ingenious. Throwing up those that are trying to follow him and someone claiming to be his friend, just how will he manage to stay alive?But, within every mission that goes wrong there is a scapegoat or someone that will be held responsible as Reza realizes an act of friendship that he thought was a wonderful kindness would be his downfall and much more. Hoping to find a way to escape he learns the identity of someone involved and that might be able to help him.Listening to Snake and hoping that he would learn more about the virus or STUXNET, we find out just what he has in mind for those involved and hope that Mark can stop him before it&#8217;s too late. Betrayals, lies, deceits, plans that go sour and so many lives at stake as we learn more about the many missions that Mark was slated for, the video war games and two women that would play an important role. One was involved in administering the &#8220;designer&#8221; drug that he experienced at the beginning of the novel and later on when he lost memory of certain incidents. The other a Mossad agent linked to the first but how and why?So, what would happen if the tables were turned and Mark had the power to administer to others what was done to him? Midview-Ultra: What will he do when he gets close to his victim? Will he be able to pull it off and supply Iran with someone to blame? Will MISIRI get their man and hand him over to Ahmad? An ending so explosive and a mission that did not end. What is the final outcome and where will Mark go next? What happens to those involved and will Iran go through with her threats? From Afghanistan, Iran, Israel, Cyprus, Washington, Maryland and Virginia this novel explores many different issues dealing with nuclear war and weapons of mass destruction. One air force pilot that just wants to get behind the wheel of a plane and fly. A government that has other plans for him. A CIA agent, scientists, psychologists and those that are affluent in making uranium-enriched bombs provide and ending so explosive so deadly that only author Gregory S. Lamb could provide. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is at the center of this novel and in reality it is responsible for the development of new technologies for use by the military. These technologies will have a major effect on the world as well as computer networking and more. &#8220;Today, DARPA&#8217;s mission is still to prevent technological surprise to the US, but also to create technological surprise for our enemies.&#8221; Wikipedia.

Her whit and fabulous story lines and absorbing characters manage to capture my attention fully and hold me until the very last second. This story was a complete page turner, I did not want to put it down.Dominic definitely off the page SEXY!!! Loved him. His past has made him who he is today but his family has kept him grounded. His troubles with people is completely understandable being used and not really feeling like he has anyone interested in him for him other than his title or belongings. Trust is a huge part of his life and he takes it very seriously. As a man he is wonderful he has some excellent flirtatious lines that get Zoe ramped up.Zoe is hilarious she is completely blunt and entirely honest no holes barred. LOVE that!!!! I love how she flirts with Dom and the way she sees him. I love that she never gave up on on Dominic listening to her presentation. She is entirely suited to Dom's character as a the female lead, her honesty will get her everything.The whole Kidnap and make him listen is a great idea, who doesn't want to kidnap an Italian Price for a fantasy or four.Their physical attraction is immediate within seconds of their first meeting and it sizzles from that second onward. Their sexual attraction is very potent and they come together in an explosive and surprising union which is off the charts hot. The first encounter is a sizzling scorchfest and leaves you little time to fan yourself until the next bout.Them falling in love is inevitable and I love that their time together on the island cemented their bond. Having two leads fall in love with such a high sexual attraction and physical bond can be hard to convince readers that the love is real yet Nicola Marsh takes that challenge and and blows your mind.Catarina the Queen is Hilarious and a closet matchmaker who hopes for her grandsons happiness hopefully with Zoe. Her involvement in them getting together is crucial, she is the voice that gives them the truth they needs to realise what they have.The islands sound beautiful and spectacular I want to go and I want Dom with me.After reading this I really need to read the first in the Feel the Heat series (Wicked Heat) and get Allegra's story and I see her male lead is Australian HOT!!!!!

My first experience with Ms. Jay was in her free novel Hidden Ecstasy (#0.5) which I picked up before reading Ecstasy Unbound. You don&#8217;t need to read the prequel before you pick up this series. I enjoyed both Hidden Ecstasy and Ecstasy Unbound. We get a great plot that is developed and intriguing, lots of sex, action, and mythology.Uri a guardian is a fierce alpha male. Alex is a fierce warrior in her own right. They make a perfect match. The story is fun and exciting plus the sex is scorching hot with a nice romantic side to go along with all that passion. Their is lots of sexual tension between our hero and heroine, which was enjoyable. Once they stopped avoiding each other we get some scorching hot scenes with a little M/F/M and BDSM. I had a great time learning about the worlds and characters. I grew to like and enjoy all the characters and can&#8217;t wait for each to have there own story.The writing is clear and precise. I had no trouble following along. I liked that it told me at the begging of the chapters which realm we are in. I need to note that I got a copy with the glossary. Thank you Setta for taking the time to put this together. It helped me understand the characters, relationships and world so much.If you enjoy Erotica PNR with lots of action of all sorts, then this one is for you. I had a fun time reading this installment and can&#8217;t wait to pick up Ecstasy Claimed and enjoy more of the sexy Guardians of the Realms.Disclaimer: I received a complimentary copy free of charge from the author with the sole purpose of an honest review.

Even the smaller novels like this one can really have good lessons and they are not corny like many of the books under 200 pages. Believe me, I have started many I don't ever finish because I can't stand the writing.Love in the Wind is about Maddie and Grady. Maddie has just recently(okay, about 2 years ago) been told that her father isn't really her father. She meets her birth father and instantly wants to prove herself to him. They both have something in common, sailing. On different levels as he is rich and wealthy but still racing. Her best friend is Taylor. He likes her, believes he is in love with her, but close to race time, he breaks his leg while skiing in Colorado. So he calls in his friend Grady.Grady is nice. A little bit different but I liked him. He is nowhere near as controlling as Taylor. More of a protective person. And let me tell you, the early morning jog he takes with Maddie is pretty hilarious. Did I mention 5 AM? When neither of them are morning people and she is just trying to test him:) I laughed out loud when I read this section.One of my favorite characters was Lindy. She owns a shop in town where Maddie works under her. There is a part where Lindy was given a gift from her husband that is really sweet. She is an older woman with lots of wisdom to impart. I love people like this! I can sit and listen, talk and chat with those who know things but don't act all bossy and like they are above you. The epitome of a southern woman misplaced:)Another excellent story that I thoroughly enjoyed!

What is particularly noteworthy, in addition to the fact that they have each been very satisfactory reads, is the variation in the subject matter of the stories. Hence it is no surprise that this time round the author has attempted something completely different. Although billed as a science fiction story, this has distinct fantasy overtones and, in my opinion, is his best work so far.This is quite a short story running to just a couple of hundred well spaced pages. However, a lot of ground is covered. In some ways this could be described as a good old fashioned morality tale. The divide between good and evil is quite clear cut and there is no ambiguity about which of the characters are goodies and which are the baddies! Naturally the bad guys are attempting dastardly deeds which the good people are doing their best to thwart, and, like all tales of this type, the reader is never in any real doubt that good will triumph over evil in the end. However, that is not to take anything away from this story as it a well written and absorbing book and not one which the reader will want to put down. Many will read it in just one sitting.Clearly there is quite a lot of mileage in Prince V'sair and the planet Darracia should the author choose to go in this direction and if so it will certainly be on my reading list.

I think my biggest problem with it was that the first book was just so unique, so magical with so much going on that it was just impossible to capture the same sense of wonder that the original contained.  Nevertheless I had a fun time reading it and the nostalgic factor was off the charts.  The first third of the book is just full of so many moments that triggered my memory and truly made me feel like I was coming home.  This was a very nice book to read during Christmas and the Holiday's.  In it's own way it's kind of a Christmas book even though it has nothing to do with Christmas.The Good Things:1. Nostalgic factor: During the first part of the book on while Macy is on Earth there's just so many little things that reminded me of the first book.  When she walks by Balthazar, the diamond earrings, her being comforted by warm caramel ever since waking up from her coma, little things here and there like a picture, her being fascinated by older times and the list just goes on and on.2. Getting to see Chanticleer again.  Since the first book I've been fascinated by the concept of Chanticleer and have fond memories of reading Macy's journey to face her fears.  I just love the setting.3. The characters - For the most part.  I enjoyed all of the characters immensely especially BingThe Not So Good Things:1. Chanticleer was just different this time.  It wasn't that it was bad but I think a big part was that it was impossible to capture the same sense of magic and wonder that I felt reading the first one.  It's kind of like The Wizard of Oz or Star Wars.  The first time is just simply magical and while each subsequent trip is always fun, it's just impossible to capture that same sense of magic and wonder of seeing it the first time.2. The Story just wasn't as good as the first one for me.  There were just a few little things here and there that just felt, I don't know, different?  I can't really put my finger on it and I think it's probably just me.  Like I said it didn't have the same type of magic, it had it's own magic but I was so looking forward to another trip down the same Chanticleer road although I should have realized things couldn't be the same this time.Did I enjoy the book?  Yes very much so.Would I gladly recommend this book?: You betcha!Was it as good as the first? That's a hard question to answer. I didn't think so but you might feel otherwise so give it a try if you want. If you haven't read the Shells of Chanticleer yet I highly recommend that you do so.  It is a great book that has an extremely unique ideas and is sort of mysterious, hazy, trippy even and was a fun adventure that's still stuck in my head to this day.  I really wish I had liked this one as much but I just didn't.  I am very glad I read it.  Parts of it were as good if not better than the first but there were some parts that just didn't sit so well with me.

This is the kind of book that we need right now.  Right now as states hash out the war on the GL crowd. Being Trans-Gender will be the next war that these people will have to fight.  I think its horrible that these people have to go through this.  Not being able to marry who you love should never be an issue.  I may be straight but I support them in all their endeavors. This books only issue for me was that Adam pretends to be Trans-Gender even through he isn't.  The other thing is that it has its moments of feeling more like a textbook vs. a novel.Other than that this book was AMAZING!The characters are strong the story breath taking and a very quick read. I really loved that Adam is open about his sisters life style.  Its so wonderful to hear when family accepts those around them and even more so when its family.  This book will make you think about how things have changed over the years.  20 years ago you would never hear people talking openly about being gay etc.  And now we have rallies of people going to restaurants to show their pride, festivals, and even parades. That are all mentioned on the news etc. Its amazing how far we have come to openly accept those around us.  And I hope that the courts continue this by allowing this community to be more open about it by being able to marry who they wish. etc.Go Into This One KnowingIt will take you through gender lingo, difference between gender identity and sexual preference, and it will feel like Queer/Trans 101.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "40% Textbook 60% Story", "unixReviewTime": 1404086400, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2014"}

Not because the content isn't sad or heart tugging, or graphic, or worthy of it. I just didn't. I think because I knew I was going to read about a life-changing tragedy my brain disconnected from my emotions as a defense mechanism or something. It certainly had nothing to do with the story telling.It's been quite a while since I've reviewed a non-fiction book. I think the last one was Lost in Austen. A very different subject than the tornado that hit Joplin, MO.I found it very helpful to read the two sections at the beginning. They describe how tornadoes work/are formed and how the timeline of the Joplin tornado played out. You may be tempted to skip them thinking, 'I don't need to know that stuff to read the story'. Maybe not, but I'd advise you to read them. They really helped me understand what happened and why people there reacted the ways they did.The 'story' part follows about seven families from before the tornado to after. I had a hard time keeping the families straight, and had to keep referring to the description of family page. Thanks for including that Ms. Heiner or I would've been very lost! But, I think my difficulties had more to do with my brain than the storytelling. These events were given in sequence through interviews with Ms. Heiner so they are all first hand accounts of what happened and then she used her beautiful ability with word craft to put them on the page and bring them larger than life into your imagination.There is also a section at the end that tells you how to get prepared for a tornado and what to do in various scenarios if one should hit where you live. You may be tempted to skip this part too. But, keep this in mind, wherever you live, a natural disaster can occur. Tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, mudslides, wild fires, earthquakes, etc. No one is immune. So, get your 72 hour kit and food storage together, along with all your important docs so you'll be ready. Lots of great info back there.One thing that stood out about the book (SPOILER HERE) none of the families represented lost family members. All are intact at the end of the tornado. I inquired of Ms. Heiner why there was such an obvious imbalance in the stories represented as certainly there were many families who weren't so fortunate. Her response was along the lines of it was too painful to share and they didn't want to risk exploitation. I can appreciate both.Worth a read? Yes. It will wake you up, make you appreciate all you have, and how easily and quickly it can be taken from you.

I like this author but, for some reason, I just couldn't like the book. The plot was original, but the characters were an annoyance. The scenes were repetitive in that they had the \"same stuff, different place\" aspect going for them. Gemma keeps secrets from Alex because he's keeping secrets from her. This theme goes on, meaning the author overstates this in each chapter by wording it differently. It honestly had gotten old after a half dozen times .Another frustrating aspect of this book was the reader had no problem figuring out the \"who, what, where, when and, sometimes, why\" of the story. Yet the characters remained clueless until nearly the end. If Gemma was tasked to do everything incorrectly, then her mission would have been accomplished in this book. She called to mind the proverbial \"airhead\" who ventures out into the creepy, foggy night, only to run into the forest because she's now being chased by the killer...just to end up tripping over nothing and getting caught.

She can't ask about any of their missions or really anything that could compromise them. Traveling there she had to wear a blindfold but when she takes it off and her eyes laid on the hot sexy chiseled man in front of her she is done for.Noah Steele is the leader of the special forces team Brianna is writing about.

He was on a mission when she had to leave so they didn't even get to say goodbye.

Trying to get to her before they kill her is going to be the most difficult thing he has to do. Especially when they are out to kill him as well. Will he be able to keep them both alive? Will he be able to forgive her and understand that she did this to protect him?Holy hell I have just found my new book boyfriend. Noah was panty melting.

More importantly&#8230;how do I get out of it?&#8217;In this novel, Rory Scherer takes us on a roller coaster ride through the life (before he was captured) of our protagonist, an unnamed male, who is just a bit unlucky.  He&#8217;s unlucky in finding a job that he can keep for any period of time, let alone one he actually enjoys.  And don&#8217;t imagine he&#8217;s fared any better with romance.  His best friend is Will -&#8216;Can&#8217;t two dateless heterosexual friends go to a celebration of their graduation from high school together?&#8217;-  and Will helps him get a job, at an investment company.  After three weeks he&#8217;s just starting to feel a little comfortable.  He takes some work home one night, manages to sleep in, and is late for work.  Just in time to see men dressed in black carrying boxes of records out of the office, and to learn that the CEO has been arrested for stealing millions from the company.  So that&#8217;s the end of that job. Or is it?  How does he end up tied to a chair being threatened by three big men?&#8216;It is coming back to me.&#8217;It&#8217;s a short novel (around 114 pages) and intensely, laugh-out-loud funny.  There&#8217;s plenty of parody and plenty of drama in some absolutely unbelievable situations.  And some of the near unbelievable situations are pretty funny as well: especially the Parkdale Euchre Championships.  Oh, and plenty of digressions as well.  How else would we learn about Will&#8217;s addiction to internet pornography, and his late great Aunt Edna?It&#8217;s funny, it&#8217;s over the top and because the eyes we see it through are those of our unnamed protagonist, it&#8217;s a uniquely interesting view of the world.

To me, she is actually the villan and with a best friend like her, who would honestly need an enemy.

That is, people who think that if a movie or a book is not saturated with action, it is not worth their time. So, even when the story does not require an action sequence, Rollins inserts one. For discerning readers, the result is poisonous, agonizing pulp.Not only is the action excessive, much of it is implausible. The early boat chase on the Yangtze River? Not only can it be deleted without affecting the story, the end of the chase is silly. It is inappropriate for a serious novel, though fine for a comic book. Later on Rollins inserts a sequence reminiscent of John Wayne's prominent Rooster Cogburn sequence in TRUE GRIT. The difference is that Rooster Cogburn's is more realistic. And near the end of the book, we have a super-sandstorm that is miraculously cooperative. Its timing is too perfect. It seems to tell the characters, \"Tell me when I should arrive, to make your story suspenseful. If you need me to slow down a bit, be sure to inform me.\"The modus operandi of SANDSTORM--and I assume the other books in the series--is interesting. (It's what sucked me in.) Sigma Force is an elite group of men and women with military training and academic savvy. Their missions involve the procurement of new research and technology.

It's the first book by Paul Theroux that I've read. It's my understanding that he first became famous for his travelogue \"The Great Railway Bazaar (1975).\" He's written a number of novels since and most (maybe all) are fictionalized travelogues by having their characters end up in some exotic and isolated corner of the world. That's certainly the case with this book.This story evolves around a man who is so fed up with what he perceives as deteriorating quality of life in the United States that he takes his family (wife and four children) to the most isolated place he knows of, the Mosquito Coast on the east coast of Honduras. Once there he goes up river trying to find a place untouched by civilization. He has the gift of having no doubt that he always right. No matter what happens, he insists--and apparently believes it himself--that he's not surprised because he was expecting it all along.He sets up a machine to make ice from heat energy of fire and expects the natives to be grateful. The results are mixed and from there it gets worse. He hates the missionaries who he believes are contaminating the natives with civilization. But he thinks his ice machine is a good idea of course.The story is told in first person by the man's son. As the story progresses it becomes obvious that his father is out of touch with reality (i.e crazy). Things get tense toward the end of the book.The book provides an entertaining way to learn about the geography of the up-river areas of the Mosquito Coast of Honduras.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Popular Book from the 1980's", "unixReviewTime": 1403654400, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2014"}

The letter forces unwanted memories to surface, memories of Tom's capture and imprisonment, first by Italians and then by Germans, while serving as an intelligence officer in the North Africa Campaign during World War II. That brief introductory scene is followed by a captivating examination of a man who is bound not just by the fences and razor wire of prison camps (bitter Edens policed by fallen angels), but by unwanted and uncontrollable emotions.In the context of confinement, Bitter Eden centers on Tom's struggle to define love and to separate his love for another man from sexual desire. As grim days pass in the Italian camp, Tom reluctantly forms relationships with two men. One is a friendship with a mothering gay man named Douglas to whom he feels no attraction but comes to regard with affection. The other involves an attraction (and eventual devotion) to a married man named Danny who is (for much of the novel) hostile to openly gay men. Tom and Danny bond naturally, having both been victims of paternal abuse. Tom does his best to deny his feelings for Danny, or to define them as nonsexual, a challenging task when Danny sleeps next to him in a platonic but naked embrace. Jealousies are aroused and magnified when a gay artist paints Tom in the nude and when Tom begins to perform with the openly gay cast of the prison theater.Bitter Eden deals with a subject that might discomfort some readers, but does so with sensitivity and compassion and gorgeously descriptive prose. Yet no reader should be made uncomfortable by a story that is ultimately about love, \"an emotion too often threatened by ennui to attain to the grand passion for which I have long since ceased to hope.\" Tatamkhulu Afrika (who was, like Tom, a POW in Italy and Germany) vividly conveys the drudgery and deprivation and fear that pervades life in a prison camp, as well as the uncertain life that follows liberation, \"the now's new ambiences, changed circumstances, grown alien strictures and codes.\" The story is dramatic and eventful but most of the events are small and the story's power resides in their accumulative impact on Tom. The extreme circumstances that give rise to Tom's self-examination raise profound questions about the nature of love and bonding under trying circumstances.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Defining love", "unixReviewTime": 1393372800, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2014"}

You may not know these people, but feel you might, and know that if you did happen to meet you would be welcomed into their circle.And the characters and their lives are also real: two forty-something brothers sharing an apartment in Brooklyn with the girlfriend of one of them. Barrett, the younger, is gay and works in a vintage store in Manhattan; on the way home one night, he sees a mysterious aqua light appear in the sky over Central Park, a miracle that he keeps to himself at first, but that turns him towards a kind of religion. Tyler, his older brother, is chasing his own miracle; a musician, he is still hoping for a breakthrough as a song-writer, and takes drugs to transport him to the necessary nirvana. Meanwhile, he is going ahead with his wedding to Beth (co-owner of the store where Tyler works), even though she is in the fourth stage of cancer.I don't really remember the Hans Andersen story of the same title that Cunningham is apparently reworking here, nor am I sure of its essential point. Certainly, there is a lot of snow and ice imagery, literal and otherwise, and I think I see a common theme of two people (though by no means children here) living close together in an urban setting, until each finds a way to unlock something essential that had been frozen within them. Section by section, chapter by short chapter, the affairs, hopes, and delusions of these three people and their immediate friends are portrayed with wonderful reality. Further, their situation changes in slow but significant ways over the four-year span -- the novel runs from the presidential elections of 2004 to those of 2008, and Cunningham makes no secret of his sympathies. But I felt very little direction or momentum as I was reading, and could easily have laid it down at any time and not bothered to pick it up again.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Beautiful, true&#8230; and a little boring", "unixReviewTime": 1399680000, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2014"}

I wouldn't have been able to do this for fear that no one would care, but Mr. Spector doesn't care about that.

Griff was a rising star in the mage community. That is until the day he kills a councilor in front of witnesses. That this action is totally out of character for Griff is ignored. He is convicted &#8216;in absentia&#8217; and now he has gone to ground.Rick wants to clear his Father&#8217;s name. His Father was found guilty of using Dark Magic when Rick was still a young boy. The disgrace still haunts his family. When Rick is given the chance to have his Father&#8217;s case reopened if he agrees to investigate Griffin Dare&#8217;s case, he agrees. Logic dictates that someone is helping Dare to remain hidden, because how else is he able to shield himself for so long?  All Rick needs is an inside scoop with the Dare family. Working under a two week deadline, Rick decides to go to a showing of Caroline's work, hoping to strike up a relationship with the young woman. What he expected to find is a woman riding the coat tails of her wealthy and talented parents, using their connections to forward her career. What he doesn&#8217;t expect is to find a woman who is talented in her own right. Rick&#8217;s first attempts to connect with Caro are gently rebuffed. It isn&#8217;t until the next day when the critics begin to question the ability&#8217;s of a blind person to see the colors that she has so beautifully woven , that Caro reaches out to Rick and asks for his help as a PR specialist. Rick soon realizes it will not be easy to get Caro to open up to him. Despite their mutual attraction, she isn&#8217;t ready to reveal anything about her brother.It isn&#8217;t until Rick saves her life that Rick gets that chance. But by this time, he finds himself falling under the spell of this beautiful woman. Unfortunately, Rick&#8217;s boss takes matters into his own hands, and, using information he gained illegally, Stan pens an article under Rick&#8217;s name. Caro initially doesn&#8217;t believe Rick when he insists he is innocent. It isn&#8217;t until Rick approaches Caro&#8217;s Father, Stuart Dare, a lawyer, to handle his case,  that Caro slowly begins to see the truth in what Rick had been trying to tell her.Nancy Northcott does a fantastic job with &#8220;Sentinel&#8221;.

He says accounts of the massacre are &#8220;hotly contested.&#8221; In other words, the truth cannot be ascertained. Gordis whitewashes the massacre, a war crime atrocity which is one chapter in the Israeli holocaust of the Palestinians. This type of holocaust denial will not land the denier in jail. There is not even a plaque marking the site of the Deir Yassin massacre. Never forget? When it comes to Israeli slaughters of Palestinians it is incumbent on us to forget in order to qualify as morally respectable in western eyes.Early in the morning of April 9, 1948, commandos of the Irgun, among whom was Mr. Gordis&#8217; hero Menachem Begin, and members of the Stern Gang, attacked Deir Yassin, an Arab village. It was several weeks before the end of the British Mandate and the declaration of the State of Israel. The village lay outside the area to be assigned by the United Nations to the Jewish state; it had a peaceful reputation; it was even said by a Jewish newspaper to have driven out some Arab militants. But it was located on high ground in the corridor between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and with the knowledge of the mainstream Jewish defense force, the Haganah, it was to be conquered and held.In spite of being better armed, the two Zionist terror gangs were at first unable to conquer the village. But after they elicited the help of a small band of Palmach troops (the elite fighters of the Haganah), Deir Yassin soon fell. The Palmach soldiers left; it was then that the massacre began. That evening over tea and cookies, in the neighboring Zionist settlement of Givat Shaul, the Jewish terrorist told foreign correspondents that over 200 Arabs were killed and forty taken prisoner. This was reported in the New York Times the very next day (April 10, 1948, p. 6).The Judaic terrorists claimed to have lost four of their own. They boasted of the &#34;battle&#34; but made no mention of the male Palestinians whom they had loaded onto trucks, paraded through some Jewish sections of Jerusalem, and then taken back to a stone quarry between Givat Shaul and Deir Yassin and shot to death. On April 13, 1948 the New York Times reported that 254 Arab men, women, and children had been killed at Deir Yassin; there was no mention of prisoners.The official Zionist leaders of the Haganah denounced the dissidents of the Irgun and the Stern Gang accusing them of massacre, robbery, looting and barbarism. Ben Gurion even sent an apology to King Abdullah. But this horrific act served the future state of Israel well. As Begin said, &#34;Arabs throughout the country, induced to believe wild tales of 'Irgun butchery' were seized with limitless panic and started to flee for their lives. This mass flight soon developed into a maddened, uncontrollable stampede. The political and economic significance of this development can hardly be over estimated.&#8221; (Begin, &#34;The Revolt,&#34; p.164)  While modern historians argue that Begin's claims were exaggerated and that the actual number of Arabs killed was closer to 100, they all agree that the massacre at Deir Yassin marked the beginning of the depopulation of over 400 Arab villages and the exile of over 700,000 Palestinians.In spite of protests by Martin Buber, Albert Einstein and other noted scholars, within a year the village was repopulated with orthodox Judaic immigrants from Poland, Rumania and Slovakia. Its Palestinian cemetery was bulldozed and its name was wiped off the map. It is today completely obliterated. The massacre site is a few hundred yards from the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum dedicated to victims of the Nazis. Yad Vashem makes no mention of the massacre of Arabs by the Judaic Nazis among whom we number Menachem Begin. Gordis has written a whitewash of a mass murderer.

The space opera aspect is also appealing.What is surprising is the relationship and dynamic between Rowen and her husband's aristocratic family. Rowen's interaction with Skorin's mother starts out shaky and leads a reader to believe it will be a mother-in-law from hell plot device. Instead, it transforms into a healthy bonding just as Rowen helps the plants on her new planet bloom to their full potential.

The superficiality and backstabbing snobbery of the well-to-do college dilettantes is caustically underscored throughout.  This is the story of a young, wealthy woman who gets dumped by her handsome, hen-pecked boyfriend and shortly after that gets disowned by her parents when they discover she has been lying to them and re-purposing their tuition money.The dialogues sparkle with angst, wit, and humor.  It was a pleasure watching Jan make her own way and learn from her mistakes as the story progressed.  I personally have little in common with Jan as my upbringing was decidedly more modest but that simply allowed me the pleasure of discovery and mental comparison I otherwise would have missed out on.I profoundly disliked Jan in the early chapters, and was actually quite sympathetic to her ex&#8217;s reasons for giving her the ol&#8217; heave ho. However, as Jan&#8217;s perception of herself in the larger scheme of life slowly evolved, and as her focus became less selfish, I began to like her better.

Cody Miller does. A young man in the prime of his life who just completed his MBA and is engaged to be married has one moment of careless inattention. The result is disastrous and terrifying. Cody suffers massive third degree burns over the upper portion of his body. The pain is unbelievable and is followed by months of hospitalization with infections, skin grafts, and rehabilitation. Then there are his dreams &#8211; involving a phantom Cody wandering through a burned out city populated with the ash-like remains of inhabitants &#8211; and the coiled presence of a monstrous serpent. Cody fights his boundaries and somehow breaks through &#8211; and ends up waking up healed&#8230; with a great job, and a new woman. The only problem is that Cody has two sets of parallel memories&#8230; the one that leads to his perfect life and the other depicting the fire and his brutal injuries. Both seem real, but how can that be? In addition, the love of his life &#8211; his fianc&eacute;e has disappeared.  Cody senses that she is alive, but there is some other presence, something haunting, something unworldly&#8230;Alan Ryker is a superb writer. I am a huge fan of his earlier works (especially Nightmare Man), so I approached this novel with enthusiasm. I was not disappointed. This is an astounding story. The first part of the novel, involving Cody&#8217;s accident and recovery are graphic and mesmerizing. I am not sure if the description of recovery process is accurate, but it is gripping and detailed. The psychological impact on Cody is deftly illustrated. When the supernatural components of the story take hold roughly midway through, the action shifts into overdrive and I had no clue as to how the plot would be resolved.

I did, however, enjoy Tim Burton's sequel to the classic story, and his unique vision of Wonderland, making it a little darker, a little more sinister, and a lot more interesting.A.G. Howard admits she was inspired by Burton's vision, and it shows in every detail of the story, from the way the characters dress to the creepy and highly original takes on the inhabitants of \"Wonderland\" (or Underland, as it were). The plot is complicated, but not difficult to follow (honestly, after a certain point, it was kind of easy to predict the outcome of what had happened to the original Alice and who Alyssa truly was, before the author revealed the fact). Although I normally try to avoid stories written in first-person perspective like the plague, since very few write it well, the author is a skilled enough writer to pull it off without it grating on my nerves.Well, I will admit that she did often get just a BIT too absorbed in describing Alyssa's wardrobe. Yes, she dresses like a punk fairy. Yes, her style is unique and original (except, not really; most heroines of modern fairy tales seem to wear this particular style). No, it does NOT do anything to drive the plot forward, so therefore is NOT IMPORTANT. Move along, please. I don't CARE what she's wearing.Aside from that mild annoyance, Ms. Howard's writing is descriptive and engaging, her characters are fascinating (I love Morpheus, not gonna lie. Totally rooting for him) and the plot kept me absorbed until the book was over. After which I immediately went back to purchase the sequel and the short novella that falls between.

Clearly this was written for the younger readers, so adults may not like it that well (I didn't).  There is an intriguing plot - those on the north side of the &#34;Frontier&#34; (wall) have electricity, and those on the south side don't but would do just about anything to get it.  I found the two main characters to be somewhat shallow.  Phoenix seems mostly wimpy, while Star remains a bit of a mystery throughout the book. You don't learn that much about her in book one.  Maybe her character gets developed more in the next book.This is the first book in the trilogy, but I found that it doesn't really come to any kind of conclusion - leaving you to buy the next book to find out what happens next. I typically don't read trilogies for that reason - it just seems like a marketing ploy to get you to buy more books. I get that. I was hopeful that book one would come to some kind of conclusion, but it doesn't.The plot has enough mystery to keep you guessing, but I found some weaknesses in the story.  No electricity for decades, but as soon as you are exposed to it you know how to use mobile phones and social media (including typing) like you've been doing it all your life?  Really?

I don't get why no one from the south didn't try crossing to the north during while the wall was being constructed.Overall I did not like the story.  You can't really call it a romance story and there really wasn't much romance to it.  It seems to be more about unrequited love. Also, it's got a similar theme as in the Hunger Games, but no where near the level of writing.  There's not much dialog in the story.  The story unfolds from Phoenix's point of view, and most of it is about what he is thinking.I'm not going to bother with the other books in the trilogy.

I was so impressed and lost in her novel, I had to read this one just to see where it all began and to satisfy the longing in my book lover's heart. You know when you find an exceptional author, you have to pick up everything they write. I was not disappointed in my discovery. Thank you to Howard Books for generously sending me this copy to read and review without any monetary compensation for a favorable review.One of the things that make Stephanie's novels so exceptional is she doesn't leave out any details when taking a known event from the Bible and expounding on the details that we don't know. Given that very little is known about the Samaritan women at the well that Jesus encounters, I love how Stephanie elaborated on what her life must have been like to bring her to that fateful life changing encounter we all know about from the Bible.In the novel The Well, the reader is transported back in time to the Samaritan village of Sychar, where we find ourselves meeting the famed adulterous woman, Nava who is once again bringing much shame and disgrace not only to the village but more importantly to her daughter Mara and her disabled brother Asher. Knowing that her mother has completely lost sight of what this could bring to her family if anyone discovers what she is doing, Mara takes on the role of the mother, providing for the care and feeding of her mother and Asher. Since they are among the poorest in the village, they are only able to get by with the charity of the women in town who leave whatever they can spare so Mara and Asher won't go hungry. But Mara knows the charity will only last for so long as she manages to care for her family any way she can.Fate intervenes when Jesus comes to the town of Sychar and meets Nava at the well. Just when it looks like things will get better for their family, those in the town that seek revenge instead of grace won't stop until they ensure that the laws of God are upheld in town. But once her mother is brought before the court, will there be anyone willing to stand up for righteousness against the odds? You just might be surprised at how well Stephanie writes the conclusion of her debut novel.I received The Well by Stephanie Landsem compliments of Howard Books, a division of Simon and Schuster Publishers for my honest opinion. The one thing I didn't realize is how she will preserve some of these characters for their reprising role in The Thief. I don't want to spoil it for you but trust me, if you love Biblical Fiction, you will definitely want to pick up The Well and The Thief. This is such an exceptional journey because you feel as though you're not just reading the story but actually living there. Just the violent act of stoning is something I am glad we don't do any longer and it seems it would be a painful and slow death at the hands of people who believe their are justified in their actions. This reminds me of mob-like vigilante's of the ancient days. I easily give this a 5 out of 5 stars in my opinion.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "If you love Biblical Fiction, TRUST ME, pick this series up!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1394496000, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2014"}

After dozens of books casting Woodvilles as evil, Yorkists as saviors, and Lancastrians as inept usurpers, this author will make you rethink the stereotypes and assumptions. In this particular novel, it is Margaret of Anjou we are tempted to think of as a devoted and upstanding queen rather than the she-wolf ravaging England with her hired mercenaries.It was a challenge. While I don't know that I feel much more sympathy for Margaret after this reading, I certainly mourned for each follower of hers who was slain fighting for her lost cause. How I would love to get a moment with one of these noblemen so that I could ask them, &#34;What made you go forth to an almost certain death in an attempt to put the addled descendant of a Lancastrian usurper back on the throne?&#34;Higginbotham corrects some often stated assumptions about Margaret, such as the one that has her ordering the heads of York, Salisbury, and Rutland to be displayed on the gate at York. Other authors have Margaret personally leading and commanding troops which is unlikely to have ever happened. Unfortunately, even this more realistic look at Margaret made me wish she had just chosen to retire into obscurity rather than continue to rile up dissention in favor of her husband who she admits is not fit to rule.Maybe I've read too much Yorkist propaganda, but I felt like the reasons for the rebellion were not really given. We are supposed to sympathize with Henry because these noblemen are inexplicably turning against him, but of course that's not true. There were reasons, otherwise why would men fight for Richard and then Edward?Though Higginbotham does an exemplary job of writing historical characters from a refreshing point of view and uses the switching first person point of view better than anyone else, I still have a difficult time really liking anyone in this book. Maybe they're too real and nobody stands out as a hero or victim, but I wanted someone to stand out and make me want to get out there and fight myself.Overall, this is a very thoughtful and well-researched look at the Wars of the Roses.

There were aspects to it I loved and aspects that had me cringing.  Let's start with the good.I absolutely love this concept.  I have no problem imaging rich, entitled, self absorbed playboy types betting with young women's hearts.  Though I can't say I would condone it, I can't help but find it totally interesting.  And...well, if you're fool enough to fall for the game..hey, maybe you deserved the hard life lesson that follows.Dawn isn't fool enough though.  She knows all too well how this game works and her snappy attitude was another of the things I loved.  She played along with Max and Freddy only enough to get a few luxury dates out of it but never willingly serving up her heart as the prize. I also love that she isn't your typical, twig thin, model like, perfect heroine.Freddy and Max, on paper, seem like interesting guys.  Faulty and emotionally damaged but interesting.  Freddy seems generally just lost in life with only a need for self satisfaction and caring for Max.  Max is a gambling addict with little other interest in life, it's all about winning.So, here is what did not work for me.I found a strange disconnect in the boys.  They are late twenties, if memory serves, yet their actions felt much younger.  However, on the flip side, their mannerisms and speech felt stuffy and old all too often.  Now, I don't frequently hang out with the rich and privileged, so maybe this is right on.  It just felt weird, it was a large hang up for me.  I'm a character driven reader and I just could not get enough of a handle on these two to care as much I should.This is not normally an issue I bring up when I get an ARC for review, but this one really needed a good polish from a thorough editor.  I understand random mistakes, we all make them, but there were several reoccurring  ones that just became distracting for me.  Again, I'll blame this on my disconnect with the characters.  Had I fallen into their world easier, these errors would have been easier to overlook.Now, here is the thing.  Even though I had a hard time with this read, I still want the next bit of story.  Do you see my dilemma here?  How do I rate a book I didn't really feel, but want more of? Yeah, I don't know either, so we'll middle of the road it with a 2.5 and keep fingers crossed for stronger delivery in book two.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Even though I had a hard time with this read, I still want the next bit of story.", "unixReviewTime": 1389052800, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2014"}

While she was there back in Lucky Harbor the reality show she was part of is now airing. She can't tell anyone how far she went. Leah was concerned about how Jack's mother was coping with her cancer that she told her that Jack was seriously dating her.Jack is a firefighter. He tries to take care of everyone. He had always been their for Leah in her teen years. He is worried about his mom. Ends up setting up a pretend relationship with Leah. He has all these rules.The whole town of Lucky Harbor are watching and posting on facebook how their romance is going. Also on facebook a pole of who will end up with Leah.Kevin is Jack's dog and has his own personality.This is book #8 in Lucky Harbor, Washington.I really enjoy this community of characters and their relationships with each other.

        +{"reviewerID": "A1RPTVW5VEOSI", "asin": "0547719280", "reviewerName": "Michael J. Edelman", "helpful": [2, 4], "reviewText": "The subtitle of this book is \"FDR, Ford Motor Company, and their epic quest to arm an America at war\" but that's only half the book- and perhaps not the most accurate description; a better subtitle would have been something like \"Edsel Ford's struggle to run Ford Motor and to help arm the US in WWII.\" The name Edsel Ford is known to most Americans (if at all) as the punchline to a joke- what's the worst American car ever made? The Edsel wasn't the worst car made, but it was a famously unsuccessful attempt to produce a mid-priced car to compete with similar offerings from GM and Chrysler. The real Edsel Ford, for whom the car was named, was the only child of Henry Ford.  He was responsible for most of Ford's innovations, beginning with the Model A, and was solely responsible for Ford's entry into defense work prior to World War II, very much against the wishes of Henry Ford.If the name of Edsel Ford isn't well known today it's largely because of his father, who shameless stole the credit for Edsel's work and treated him very harshly. The elder Ford was a hard taskmaster to tried to force his son to be more like himself, and an ardent pacifist who opposed all wars and war work. He was also, despite his early accomplishments,  an ignorant, largely illiterate man whose progressive policies, like the $5 day and being among the first auto makers to hire Black workers, was balanced by deep-seated racist and anti-Semitic beliefs.When William Knudson, FDR's director of Wartime Production, came to Ford with a request to build aircraft engines for the British, Edsel accepted- but Henry vetoed the deal. It took all of Edsel's effort and a good deal of his health to bring the old man around. The eventual result was not only engine production, but the first really modern aircraft production line using the methods of the auto industry. Aircraft experts doubted it could be done, but Ford's Willow Run plant eventually turned out B-24 bombers at the rate of one per hour- an astounding feat.Author A. J. Baime has written an interesting and well-documented history of Edsel Ford, Ford Motor, and Ford's role in WWII that does suffer a bit, perhaps, for trying to tell too much of the story. It begins with a sketchy version of the beginnings of Henry Ford's career that misses a number of the salient events that helped launch the company- notably Ford's famous race car, the 999, that attracted investors and buyers to his  second business venture. The story of how Ford took his company back from the investors is also incomplete.Baime mentions that Edsel Ford bought out the other Ford investors, but that's only a tiny piece of the real story. Ford had been sued by the Dodge Brothers, who were major investors, for not paying dividends. The courts sided with the Dodges, which angered Henry to no end. He announced that he was appointing Edsel as his successor and that he himself was retiring from Ford to start a new company. That depressed Ford's stock price, and it was Henry, not Edsel, who snapped up stock at a bargain price and established the family as sole stockholders.There are a few points in the narrative that seem to skip over details. For several chapters Baime focuses on the long delays in getting production of B-24s going at Willow Run, and dealing with quality issues- and then suddenly planes are pouring out the door. Baime also has the habit of ending every chapter with a little cliffhanger presaging the next chapter- something perhaps more appropriate to a Dan Brown mystery than a good history story. He does like using words like \"quotidian\" where a clearer word like \"everyday\" would suffice. And then there are curious constructions like this description of Edsel Ford: \"He smoked his cigarettes like he played golf: left handed, and with panache.\" What exactly is he trying to say here?Stylistic affectations aside, this is a useful, well researched, well documented, and interesting book. While the story of Henry Ford and the Ford Motor Company has been told many times (I would particularly recommend Douglas Brinkley'sWheels for the World: Henry Ford, His Company, and a Century of Progress) and Detroit's role in WWII has also been told in books likeDetroit Goes to War: The American Auto Industry in World War II, I don't think there are any other popular books that go into detail on Ford's involvement in WWII. For that reason, this is a good contribution to popular histories of that era.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Edsel Ford and the B-24", "unixReviewTime": 1401321600, "reviewTime": "05 29, 2014"}
